Abstract
Fatigue is one of the most important symptoms for patients with RA, and imposes a great burden on
patients’ lives, being associated with significantly reduced health-related quality of life. Although being
recognized by the rheumatology community as a major gap in the current management of the disease,
fatigue has not been easy to measure and conceptualize. Part of the problem seems to reside in themultidimensional causality of this phenomenon, which may warrant dedicated measures and interventions.Although there are several instruments available to measure it, no consensus has yet been reached torecommend a ‘gold-standard’. This review aims at synthesizing the role of fatigue in the global impact ofRA; describing validated instruments and their psychometric properties as measures of fatigue amongpatients with RA; and finally proposing a clinically meaningful, valid and feasible process to measurefatigue in clinical practice.
Key words: arthritis, rheumatoid, fatigue, psychometrics, outcome assessment (health care)
Rheumatology key messages
.Fatigue is a significant component of the global impact of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

.Clinicians could screen fatigue in RA with single-item instruments, complemented with multidimensional ones if
needed.
Introduction
Fatigue is a common and persistent problem in musculo-
skeletal and rheumatic diseases, including RA [1, 2]. It
affects around 40 /C15080% of these patients [3, 4], being
defined as severe in about half of the cases [3, 5 /C1507], and
has negative impact upon health-related quality of life [8].Fatigue is experienced as being overwhelming, unpredict-
able, extreme, not restored by sleep, multidimensional
and part of a vicious circle in which fatigue feeds andfosters itself [9, 10]. Coherently, fatigue is considered as
one of the most important disease outcomes by patients[8, 11, 12]. It has received increased attention over the
past decade and has been recommended by theOutcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials(OMERACT) group as an important outcome domain
that should be assessed in all RA studies, alongside the
core set [13].
Despite having been historically considered an extra-
articular manifestation of RA, related to disease activity,
recent findings support a multifactorial aetiology for fa-tigue, involving an array of co-morbid factors, such as
disability, psychological well-being, social support and
‘overall evaluation of health’ [14].
The measurement of fatigue in RA entails several
challenges due to its subjective nature and close relation-
ship with cognitive and emotional dimensions [15].
Characteristics of the experience and consequences offatigue are likely to be unique in RA patients, which im-
poses the need for specific assessment instruments [13].
Generic instruments may, as an example, contain itemsthat in RA would capture the restrictions imposed by in-
flammation or disability, rather than by fatigue itself, lead-
ing to unreliable or misleading results [15]. Previous1Rheumatology Department, Centro Hospitalar e Universita ´rio de

REVIEWreviews confirmed that the majority of the numerous in-
struments used to assess fatigue in RA are well validated
psychometrically, but lack evidence of their validity in the
specific clinical context of RA [16, 17]. This may help ex-plain why no consensus has yet been reached on how to
measure it in this disease.
For the purpose of this review, and to further evolve this
area, we chose to analyse only the instruments with rea-sonable evidence of validation for measuring fatigue in RA,
diagnosed with established criteria. The aims of this review
are: (i) to synthesize the role of fatigue in the global impactof RA, (ii) to describe validated instruments and their psy-
chometric properties as measures of fatigue in patients
with RA, and (iii) to propose a clinically meaningful andvalid process to measure fatigue in clinical practice.
Importance of fatigue in the global
impact of RA
Fatigue has a significant negative impact on patients’ abil-
ity to perform daily self-care and socially relevant tasks
[18/C15020], to the detriment of physical and mental or emo-
tional well-being and personal satisfaction [14, 21]. As a
consequence of fatigue, patients experience higher levels
of interpersonal stress, including with friends and familymembers [20]. Fatigue has been found to account for36/C15044% of role limitations, 52 /C15057% of physical and
social functioning problems, 64% of mental health symp-
toms, and 51% of the general perception of health wor-sening in RA [21].
Work disability is among the most important conse-
quences of fatigue in RA. In fact, patients have identifiedthis symptom as the principal barrier to employment andreduced productivity [22, 23] and this has been exten-
sively demonstrated by research. In a longitudinal study,
the likelihood of absenteeism at 6 and 12 months was sig-nificantly higher in those describing more fatigue at base-
line (odds ratio (OR) 1.23; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.49). Fatigue was
also associated with activity impairment (OR 1.52; 95%CI: 0.79, 2.26) and work productivity loss (OR 4.16; 95%
CI: 2.47, 5.85) [22]. Fatigue was also associated with more
physicians’ consultations and more referrals to therapistsover time [24]. This indicates that fatigue is probably asso-ciated with considerable additional societal costs in RA
although, to our knowledge, this has not been the object
of specific publications.
Altogether, these findings can justify why fatigue is con-
sidered an important cause in ‘difficult to treat’ RA pa-
tients [25], making the management of RA morechallenging and causing greater health care utilization.
Fatigue significantly affects the assessment of disease
activity: it has been identified as the main driver of patientself-assessment of global impact of the disease (patientglobal assessment). This is true even in patients in dis-
ease remission, i.e. with good control of the inflammatory
process [26, 27]. It has been shown that when fatiguepersists, patients will not perceive the achievement
of favourable clinical outcomes [28]. Patient global as-
sessment has a significant weight in current diseaseactivity indices used to guide treatment decisions [27,
29, 30], thus conveying an indirect impact of fatigue in
heightened medication cost and risk of overtreatment.
Instruments and their psychometric
properties
The information above underlines the need to accurately
assess fatigue both in research and in clinical settings.Clearly, the choice of the instrument to measure fatigue
is an essential step and the challenge this represents
should not be underestimated. Although several instru-ments are available for this purpose, two main problemsarise. The first is their limited validation. Frequently, pub-lications using these instruments do not include refer-
ences of validation studies, or do not fully describe the
instrument. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that signifi-cant variations in wording of the questions, in time refer-ence (e.g. last week, last month) and even in the number
of items may have occurred in different instances of use of
the same instrument. This is quite clear with the single-item visual analogue scales, for which several versionswere identified [16]. The second problem relates to the
use in RA of instruments developed and validated for ap-
plication in patients with other rheumatic diseases, otherdiseases, such as cancer [16, 31], or in the general popu-lation. The use of such non-specific instruments mayentail important issues, namely ‘contamination bias’,
whereby some items may distort the assessment of fa-
tigue by influence of other distinct outcomes in RA: phys-ical function impairment or joints’ inflammatory activity.The purpose of fatigue assessment should drive the se-
lection of the instrument and sometimes both RA-specific
and non-specific instruments should be used. Whateverthe case, clinicians and researchers should consider usingonly instruments with adequate validation [16, 17], i.e. in-
struments that have been proven to measure exactly what
is purposed (validity) and that provide consistent results atdifferent time points (reliability) or are able to detect rele-vant changes over time (sensitivity to change) [32].
To select instruments for this narrative literature review
we used two criteria: (i) being the most used by cliniciansand researchers in patients with RA, according to pub-lished reports; and (ii) having reasonable evidence of val-
idation regarding acceptability, validity, reliability and
sensitivity to change in RA. Searches were limited toPUBMED and CINAHL, in the English language and with-out restriction of dates. The search strategy included the
following descriptors: fatigue, tiredness, scale, question-
naire, checklist, inventory and psychometrics. One re-searcher (E.S.) reviewed all abstracts, and then fullarticles were reviewed to identify the fatigue instrumentused and to extract information on their psychometric
properties, appraised by all researchers. We have thus
identified 12 instruments [16, 33 /C15047], which are presented
in Tables 1 and 2. Then, a score was attributed to thepsychometric properties of each instrument according to
the strength of the available evidence based on its valid-
ation studies (strong/good evidence, moderate evidence,
v4 https://academic.oup.com/rheumatologyEduardo J. F. Santos et al .low/limited evidence, not applicable) (Table 2). For more
details on the psychometric properties and full description
of the instruments, readers are advised to appraise their
validation studies (last column of Table 2) and/or previousreviews [16, 17].
Based on their characteristics and psychometric prop-
erties, all the selected instruments may be considered ad-
equate to measure RA fatigue, depending on the clinical
setting and the objectives. However, further studies andcooperative work are required to address specific needssuch as the elimination of ‘contamination bias’, theconsensual adoption of a ‘gold standard’, the definition
of clinically relevant and validated cut-offs to assist in pa-
tient care management, and the development and valid-
ation of a standardized single-item assessment tool.
The constitution of a task-force with the different stake-
holders may be the solution to achieving much-neededprogress. A complete systematic review of outcome
measurement instruments based on the current guidelines
is dearly needed and the use of the COSMIN methodology(https://www.cosmin.nl/) is imperative. Furthermore, anupdate of previous reviews is needed as they consideredTABLE 1Summary of the characteristics of the selected fatigue assessment instruments

Putting the evidence together: a
preliminary proposal to measure fatigue
in practice
Although fatigue was defined as a core outcome for clinical
trials by the ACR/EULAR [48] and was the topic of a studyinterest group of OMERACT, these leading organizationsdid not specify/recommend a gold-standard instrument toassess fatigue. The diversity of instruments and their rela-tive advantages and limitations have been the subject of
discussion by clinicians and researchers [49].
The arguments for using disease-specific vsgeneric in-
struments, or multi-item/multidimensional vssingle-item
instruments are still open [50]. One large study suggestedthat scoring different components of fatigue does not
appear to add relevant information to that provided by a
single-item instrument [51]. However, this may depend onthe intended use of the information (e.g. a self-manage-
ment intervention or a medication change). Also, a set of
qualitative studies have suggested that the RA-specific,multi-dimensional instruments are needed to fully and pre-cisely identify fatigue specific to RA [33, 52, 53].
From the patient’s perspective there are three essential
aspects of impact of disease that require assessment (the
so-called ‘Impact Triad’): the severity of an outcome (e.g.
fatigue), its importance to the patient (i.e. in comparisonwith the ‘usual’ status or with other symptoms), and pa-
tient ability to self-manage/cope with that perceived se-
verity. In other words, it is important to consider howsymptom severity and self-management may influence
patient priorities or the importance of outcomes for an
individual person [54]. The development of the BRAF-NRS considered this triad, and this was the instrumentTABLE 2Summary of psychometric properties of the selected fatigue assessment instruments

demonstrated that cognitive behavioural intervention hadshort and long term efficacy on the BRAF-NRS impact but
not a similar efficacy in coping with (only in the longer
term) or in the severity of fatigue [55].
In the absence of formal recommendations, clinicians and
researchers should consider whether their needs are best
served by a single-item instrument, a multi-item instrumentthat explores broader fatigue issues to create a global score,or a multidimensional instrument that produces subscalescores for a range of different domains of fatigue (e.g. cog-
nitive and physical fatigue) [17]. This open choice has, how-
ever, the drawback of limiting comparison across studies.
A strategic option for clinical practice may be to use a
single-item instrument as a screening tool (e.g. BRAFNRS, RAID-F), which would be supplemented by add-itional multidimensional assessments, if significant levelsof fatigue are identified by screening. This will be particu-
larly useful when the aims are to explore fatigue causality
or the efficacy of interventions [17].
Given the multifactorial nature of fatigue, it may be wise
to measure other domains of significant impact for pa-
tients. In fact, previous studies associated fatigue withspecific domains of disease impact (e.g. pain, functionaldisability and sleep disturbances [12, 56]), suggesting thatefficient interventions in these domains may contribute to
significant reductions of fatigue levels. In our opinion, the
most suitable instrument for this purpose is, currently, theRheumatoid Arthritis Impact of Disease Score (RAID) [45,46] which considers seven different domains of impact:
pain, functional disability, fatigue, emotional well-being,
physical well-being, sleep and coping. RAID was de-veloped and validated as a combined index of overallimpact, resulting from the consideration of the seven di-mensions (original formulation). The NRS used to assess
individual domains of disease impact in RAID are valid,
feasible, reliable and sensitive to change in patients withRA [46, 57, 58]. Using the seven scores separately(RAID.7i) offers a feasible tool to analyse impact of dis-ease and to design and monitor individually tailored inter-
ventions, targeting the domains of concern, and thus
indirectly improving fatigue.
Conclusions
Fatigue is, undisputedly, an outcome of outstanding im-portance for patients with RA and, thus, for the concep-tualization and achievement of treatment targets.
It should be regularly measured in both research and
clinical practice. A number of validated instruments are
available to this purpose but there is no consensus defin-
ition of gold standard.
The use of a single item tool, followed by multidimen-
sional instruments as appropriate, seems to be a suitable
proposal for clinical practice.
