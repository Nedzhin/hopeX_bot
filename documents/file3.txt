   Objectives   To investigate the effect of group cognitive 
behavioural therapy (CBT) for fatigue self-management, 
compared with groups receiving fatigue information alone, on fatigue impact among people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).    Methods   Two-arm, parallel randomised controlled 
trial in adults with RA, fatigue ≥6/10 (Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 0–10, high bad) and no recent change in RA medication. Group CBT for fatigue self-management comprised six (weekly) 2 h sessions, and consolidation session (week 14). Control participants received fatigue self-management information in a 1 h didactic group session. Primary outcome at 18 weeks was the impact of fatigue measured using two methods (Multi-dimensional Assessment of Fatigue (MAF) 0–50; VAS 0–10), analysed using intention-to-treat analysis of covariance with multivariable regression models.    Results   Of 168 participants randomised, 41 withdrew 
before entry and 127 participated. There were no major baseline differences between the 65 CBT and 62 control participants. At 18 weeks CBT participants reported better scores than control participants for fatigue impact: MAF 28.99 versus 23.99 (adjusted difference −5.48, 95% CI −9.50 to −1.46, p=0.008); VAS 5.99 versus 4.26 (adjusted difference −1.95, 95% CI −2.99 to −0.90, p<0.001). Standardised effect sizes for fatigue impact were MAF 0.59 (95% CI 0.15 to 1.03) and VAS 0.77 (95% CI 0.33 to 1.21), both in favour of CBT. Secondary outcomes of perceived fatigue severity, coping, disability, depression, helplessness, self-efﬁ  cacy and sleep were also better in CBT participants.    Conclusions   Group CBT for fatigue self-management 
in RA improves fatigue impact, coping and perceived severity, and well-being.  Trial registration: ISRCTN 32195100      
  INTRODUCTION 
 Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic, inﬂ  amma-
tory condition causing synovitis in multiple joints, 
pain, joint destruction and disability. 1  Treatment 
comprises medication to control inﬂ  ammation, 
and multidisciplinary team interventions to reduce 
symptoms and maximise self-management. 2   3  
Patients highlight fatigue as a major concern, 4  
as important as pain, 5  –  8  overwhelming, unman-
ageable and ignored by clinicians. 9  –  11  Signiﬁ  cant 
fatigue occurs in up to 70% of patients with RA, 
can be as severe as chronic fatigue syndrome, pre-dicts quality of life and is as hard to cope with as pain. 
12  –  16  The highlighting of fatigue as an unmet 
concern by patients with RA led to international 
consensus that fatigue must now be evaluated in all RA clinical trials. 
17  
 RA pharmacological treatments reduce but do 
not resolve fatigue, and associations between RA 
fatigue and measures of inﬂ  ammation, clinical 
or psychological health are only moderate. 18   19  
Fatigue is likely to have complex, multicausal path-
ways comprising varying combinations of clinical (inﬂ ammation, pain, disability) and psychosocial 
factors (mood, beliefs, coping, behaviours), 
13   19  –  23  
implying that effective fatigue self-management 
strategies are critical. Enabling self-management for people with long-term conditions is a government target 
24  and RA guidelines recommend support 
for fatigue. 2   3  Many rheumatology teams provide 
general self-management education, 25  but with 
no systematic review of RA fatigue interventions, 
 clinicians are uncertain how to help. 26  
 Multiple sclerosis fatigue was improved by a 
fatigue self-management programme of individual 
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). 27  CBT deals 
with links between thoughts and feelings that may 
drive behaviours, and uses cognitive restructuring to help patients make behavioural changes. 
28  For 
example, thoughts that tasks must be done per-
fectly, with feelings of failure if they are not, may drive excessive work patterns, leading to fatigue. In CBT, core self-management skills of problem-solv-ing and goal-setting, and peer role models (social cognition theory, SCT) enhance self-efﬁ  cacy, or 
conﬁ dence that you can do something to make a 
difference. 
29  A systematic review of general self-
management programmes in rheumatic diseases 
recommends that they incorporate SCT or CBT. 25  
A randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 16 h group (SCT) education for patients and partners, covered comprehensive topics, but not fatigue speciﬁ  cally. 
30  
Perceived fatigue improved in patients attending alone, but increased in those accompanied by part-ners. There were no other clinical or psychological beneﬁ  ts and the study was restricted to patients 
with partners. An RCT of 22 h group (SCT) CBT covered comprehensive topics, fatigue and prac-tice (eg, exercises, tai chi). 
31  Fatigue severity, pain, 
function and mood improved, but the study was 
restricted to patients with mild/moderate disabil-ity. In an RCT of 11 h individual CBT, participants selected two of four modules, with fatigue as one option. Fatigue and depression improved but no  Additional data are  ▶

restricted to people with early RA in psychological distress. 32  
 Given that RA fatigue is not strongly associated with dis-
ability, disease duration or distress 19  and occurs in at least 70% 
of patients, self-management interventions should target the 
broad RA population. Furthermore, as RA fatigue affects qual-ity of life, 
9  –  11   14   15  an intervention that changes fatigue impact 
might be expected to change wider well-being. The aim of 
this study, therefore, was to test, in an inclusive cohort, the null hypothesis that there would be no difference in change in fatigue impact between people with RA participating in a group CBT fatigue self-management programme and groups receiving fatigue information alone. Secondary outcomes were perceived fatigue severity, coping and clinical and psychological well-being. People can be at different stages of readiness to change  behaviour 
33  therefore stage-of-change data were collected for 
exploratory analysis.  
  METHODS 
  Trial design 
 This was a two-centre controlled trial of group CBT for fatigue 
self-management versus group information (usual care), with balanced randomisation (1:1), conducted in the UK.  
  Participants 
 Inclusion criteria were adults with conﬁ  rmed RA 34  scoring ≥6 
for fatigue during the past week (Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), 
no fatigue–extreme fatigue, 0–10). Exclusion criteria were change in disease-modifying drugs or biological agents within the preceding 24 weeks (glucocorticoids 6 weeks). Participants were recruited from rheumatology departments in two teaching hospitals in Bristol, UK, approached in person (consecutive patients attending clinic) or by letter (via departmental RA data-bases, randomly mailed in batches of 40). Ethics approval was obtained (North Somerset and South Bristol research ethics committee, P6/Q2006/149), and the study registered (ISRCTN 32195100). Information sheets provided neutral information on the trial arms, and patients gave written informed consent.  
  Interventions 
 The study team developed the CBT intervention from their clini-
cal chronic pain and chronic fatigue syndrome self-management programmes (NA, BK), incorporating experiences of RA fatigue from clinics (SH), self-management programmes (AH, DP) and patients (patient research partner KK). 
35  The programme 
was piloted, reﬁ  ned, then co-delivered by clinical psycholo-
gist NA and specialist occupational therapist BK, in 6 × 2 h ses-sions (weeks 1–6), with a 1 h consolidation session (week 14). Topics likely to improve fatigue self-management were included ( table 1 ). Thoughts, feelings and behaviours related to fatigue 
were addressed using Socratic (reﬂ  ective) questioning and guided discovery to enable patients to work out links themselves. 
36  
Problem-solving, goal-setting, self-monitoring of activity/rest and energy management, aimed to help patients turn cognitive and behavioural changes into improved well-being. Goal-setting occupied the second hour of sessions, each clinician taking half the group to help patients set and review personal cognitive or behavioural goals. Programme homogeneity across groups was maintained through standardised topics, tools, metaphors and handouts, delivered by the same clinicians.  
 The information-only control arm comprised a 1 h didactic 
group session delivered by a rheumatology specialist nurse (DP),

Ann Rheum Dis 2011;70:1060–1067. doi:10.1136/ard.2010.144691 1062based on the Arthritis Research UK leaﬂ  ets ‘Fatigue and RA’ and 
fatigue excerpts from ‘Looking after your joints,’ freely avail-able in rheumatology clinics. The session covered fatigue symp-toms, consequences, causes and self-management suggestions (pacing, planning, stress, sleep). Both arms received the Arthritis Research UK leaﬂ  ets.  
  Outcomes 
 Fatigue impact at 18 weeks was the primary outcome, assessed 
by the Multi-Dimensional Assessment of Fatigue scale (MAF, 0–50) 
37  and a VAS (no impact–very great impact, 0–10). 
Secondary outcomes were perceived fatigue severity (no fatigue–
extreme fatigue), coping (very poorly–very well), pain (no pain–pain as bad as it could be) and perceived disease activity (doing very well–very badly) measured using VAS (0–10). Disability was measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ, 0–3) 
38  and Personal Impact HAQ (0–9). 39  Wider outcomes were 
measured by the RA Quality-of-Life scale (0–30), 40  Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale (0–21), 41  Arthritis Helplessness 
Index (5–30), 42  RA Self-Efﬁ  cacy scale (RASE, 28–140) 43  and a 
sleep quality question (very good, fairly good, fairly bad, very 
bad), 44  recoded as a binary variable as numbers were insufﬁ  cient 
for analysis. Baseline readiness to make cognitive or behavioural 
changes was measured using the Arthritis Stages of Change (ASOC) subscales (8–40). 
33  Higher scores always reﬂ  ect worse 
health status, except fatigue coping VAS, RASE and ASOC 
where they reﬂ  ect stronger beliefs. Outcomes were measured at 0, 6, 10 and 18 weeks.  
  Sample size 
 Forty-four patients in each arm were needed to show a differ-
ence of 7 MAF points in fatigue impact between trial arms, with 90% power and estimated SD 10 points (two-tailed signiﬁ  cance 
0.05) (based on unpublished data). No minimal clinically impor-tant difference has been published for MAF in RA, but is 5 in lupus. 
45   
  Randomisation 
 The intervention and control sessions were delivered to groups, 
therefore whenever 12–16 participants had been recruited, project managers (AC, CA) emailed participant codes to epi-demiologist JP who performed randomisation off-site, using computer-generated random numbers. Allocation was 1:1 but in the event of an unequal number, the CBT arm received the additional patient. To reduce hospital visits, baseline data were collected immediately before the ﬁ  rst CBT or control session (after randomisation).  
  Blinding 
 Delivery methods and the need to encourage participants to 
make cognitive and behavioural changes, rendered blinding of participants and clinicians impossible. However, all assessments were self-reports using validated measures and analysed blind to allocation (JP).  
  Statistical methods 
 Baseline characteristics were described using means and SDs 
or numbers and percentages for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. The primary intention-to-treat analysis involved between-arm comparisons for fatigue impact outcome scores (MAF, VAS Fatigue Impact) at 18 weeks, adjusted for respective baseline values. These analyses of covariance were implemented using multivariable linear regression  models. 
Standardised effect sizes for the primary outcome were cal-culated (adjusted mean difference divided by pooled baseline SD), with >0.5 considered a large effect. Secondary sensitivity analyses of primary outcomes were conducted by (1) additional adjustment for any variables displaying imbalance at baseline; (2) ﬁ  tting multilevel mixed-effects models to investigate any clustering effect from delivery in groups and (3) multiple impu-tation (MI) techniques to investigate the impact of missing data, based on 20 imputed datasets, with baseline fatigue severity, impact, pain and perceived disease activity added to the impu-tation model as variables predictive of missingness. 
46  Secondary 
outcomes were then analysed in the same way. Further analy-
ses using repeated-measures mixed-effects analysis of covari-ance models examined the effect of interventions over time by including up to three follow-up scores per participant for each primary outcome (MAF, Impact VAS), adjusting for baseline scores. Convergence/divergence between trial arms over time was investigated by including appropriate interaction terms in the model, and the clustering effect of group delivery was again investigated by including group identiﬁ  er as a third level. All analyses were conducted using Stata version 11.   
  RESULTS 
 Of 1342 individuals invited to participate, 19% (n=254) 
responded and were eligible, and of these 66% (n=168) provided verbal consent to participate and were randomised ( ﬁ gure 1 ). Of 
the 168 randomised, 24% (n=41) withdrew from the trial before providing written consent and baseline data. Therefore a total of 127 participants were allocated to either CBT (n=65) or the control group (n=62). They were contacted for follow-up data at 6, 10 and 18 weeks after their intervention started, with 74 and 76 (58%, 60%) completing all three follow-ups for MAF and VAS, respectively. The 41 who withdrew had similar char-acteristics to the 127 who participated for gender (85.4% vs 76.2% female), age (57.6 years vs 59.2 years) and disease dura-tion (14.8 years vs 14.5 years).   At baseline, participants reported 
high levels of fatigue impact and severity, and limited ability to 
cope with fatigue ( table 2 ).  In contrast they reported lower lev-
els of disease activity and pain. Mean scores for contemplating changing behaviour were higher than pre-contemplation. There were similar characteristics across arms, apart from sleep qual-ity, which appeared poorer in CBT participants. Twenty CBT and 20 control subjects (35.4%) had attended a general RA self-management programme an average 4.0 years earlier.  
 Thirteen control groups were conducted, comprising 2–8 par-
ticipants (mean 5), with 11 CBT groups, comprising 4–9 partici-
pants (mean 6). Of the 65 CBT participants, 66.2% (43) attended most sessions (30 attended all seven, 13 attended six); 18.5% (12) attended three to ﬁ  ve sessions, largely citing illness if a reason 
was given for intermittent non-attendance; 15.4% (10) withdrew after less than three sessions, and where offered, reasons were largely poor health, or lack of interest (2). This was a pragmatic trial offered in addition to usual care, which included medication change. Forty-four (34.6%) participants had changes to major RA medication during the trial, which was similar between arms (24 (36.9%) CBT vs 20 (32.3%) control); 20 (15.7%) were receiv-ing or started antidepressant drugs (9 vs 11) and 33.1% physio-therapy or occupational therapy (20 vs 22).  
  Primary outcome 
 Primary outcome data at 18 weeks were obtained for 65% (MAF) 
and 67% (VAS fatigue impact) of the 127 participants. There

Ann Rheum Dis 2011;70:1060–1067. doi:10.1136/ard.2010.144691 1063was strong evidence of a beneﬁ  cial effect of CBT at 18 weeks 
with signiﬁ  cant differences between trial arms for fatigue impact 
( table 3 ). The standardised effect size for MAF was 0.59 (95% 
CI 0.15 to 1.03) and 0.77 for fatigue impact VAS (95% CI 0.33 to 1.21) in favour of the CBT intervention. Neither additional adjust-ment for variables possibly imbalanced at baseline (age, gender, sleep, disease duration and readiness to change), nor inclusion of ‘group’ using multilevel models made any material difference to the primary outcomes, therefore results from the simple analyses of covariance are presented. Analyses based on MI of missing data resulted in slight attenuation of effects and improvements in precision, but made no material difference to the conclusions drawn from primary analyses. Adjusted treatment differences for MI models were MAF −4.13 (95% CI −7.86 to −0.40, p=0.03) and VAS −1.47 (95% CI −2.39 to −0.55, p=0.002).   
  Secondary outcomes 
 There was evidence of a beneﬁ  cial effect of the intervention on 
fatigue coping and perceived severity ( table 4 ). In addition, there were beneﬁ  cial effects on disability, depression, helplessness, 
self-efﬁ  cacy and sleep. Again, additional adjustment for age, 
gender, sleep, disease duration, readiness to change or group made no difference. There was no evidence of an intervention effect on perceived disease activity, pain, anxiety, quality of life or disability impact.   
  Effects over time 
 The median number of follow-ups for each person was four, 
with this being true for 60% (n=76) of individuals. Repeated-measures mixed-effects analyses showed no interaction effects with time, for fatigue impact (MAF p=0.68 for interaction terms; VAS impact p=0.16) ( ﬁ gure 2 ). Main effects (average difference 
across all time points) for CBT versus control were −4.57 for MAF (95% CI −6.57 to −2.57, p<0.001) and −1.47 (95% CI −2.01 to −0.93, p<0.001) for VAS impact.   By the end of the main 
6 week CBT programme there appeared to be clinical differences 
emerging between the arms for fatigue and clinical variables, maintained at 10 weeks (online supplementary table 5). These

multiple testing), and as the ﬁ  nal booster CBT session occurred 
at 14 weeks, the primary end point was 18 weeks.   
  DISCUSSION 
 These results indicate an effect of group CBT for fatigue self-
management on fatigue impact, coping and perceived severity and a range of clinical and psychological variables. The minimal clinically important difference for VAS fatigue severity is 1, 
47  
and fatigue impact probably lies within a similar range, implying this mean change (2.03) is clinically relevant. Pain and perceived disease activity were not changed, but their association with fatigue remains unclear 
19  and although fatigued, participants did 
not report high baseline levels of either. 
 The study was limited by withdrawal of participants before 
baseline, many citing unsuitable session dates or ﬂ  are/illness 
(none reported being too tired). Baseline data were collected 
after randomisation, which might potentially have biased responses, but the data showed that groups were well matched. Participants had low baseline scores for pre-contemplating change, suggesting others who are in pre-contemplation might have been less likely to agree to a self-management programme. However, adjusting for readiness to change did not alter the ﬁ  nd-
ings. Readiness to change was only measured at baseline, there-fore we could not evaluate whether people progressed through stages during the intervention, although related concepts of self-efﬁ cacy and helplessness improved. Some participants did not 
complete all follow-ups but the majority of CBT participants attended all or most sessions, suggesting commitment to the intervention. The impact of missing data, as considered using MIs, is unknown. These may not be missing at random, poten-tially giving slightly inﬂ  ated treatment effects. It was not possi-ble to blind participants and staff, but self-report measures were analysed blind to arm allocation. There was no control for the social effects of six group CBT sessions, as it was considered six control sessions giving fatigue information alone would mean  Table 3     Primary outcome scores for fatigue impact at 18 weeks

Ann Rheum Dis 2011;70:1060–1067. doi:10.1136/ard.2010.144691 1065high attrition. However, studies that have controlled for social 
effects by matching numbers of group sessions, still show CBT to be superior. 
31  Many participants had medication changes for 
RA inﬂ  ammation, in this pragmatic trial reﬂ  ecting usual clinical 
practice. However, these changes were not obviously different between arms, and association between inﬂ  ammation and RA fatigue remains unclear. 
19  Future research should evaluate the 
longer-term effects of CBT for RA fatigue, cost-effectiveness for 
this CBT programme versus longer durations 30   31  and individual 
versus group CBT. 32   48  
 Other self-management interventions based on CBT or SCT 
have improved fatigue but were tested in restricted RA popu-
lations, 30  –  32  while this CBT intervention improved fatigue 
in a broad range of patients with RA experiencing fatigue. 
Furthermore, ﬁ  ndings were not altered when adjusted for age, disease duration, gender or baseline stage of change, suggesting a widely applicable intervention. 
 This CBT intervention focused entirely on thoughts, feel-
ings, behaviours, personal interactions, stressors and issues 
likely to have an impact on fatigue, yet demonstrated a wide range of additional clinical and psychological beneﬁ  ts. Such 
wider beneﬁ  ts were also seen in a general CBT/SCT interven-tion that dealt with fatigue 
31  but not in two other CBT/SCT 
interventions. 30   32  All four interventions have similar theoreti-
cal underpinnings, therefore possible reasons for differences 
in wider outcomes may lie in the populations or outcome measures selected, or the social enhancement of group CBT versus individual CBT or with a partner. 
30   32  This 13 h group 
CBT intervention concentrating on fatigue, produced wide-
ranging clinical and psychological beneﬁ  ts similar to those of a broader 22 h group CBT intervention with a range of topics (including fatigue) and practice sessions. 
31  Concentrating on 
improving fatigue self-management may lead to improvement 
in well-being if those broader variables are driven by fatigue. Alternatively, the skills that patients develop to manage fatigue may also be useful in managing mood and thus improve well-being. A direct comparison of fatigue-focused versus broader self-management programmes might elucidate potential mechanisms. 
 During the stressors and communication sessions, patients 
reported that personal interactions with family can be both supportive and stressful in relation to fatigue. Personal 
 interactions play a role in RA fatigue 
49  and attending groups 
with a partner increased fatigue. 30  CBT is more commonly 
delivered to  individuals, exploring their unique links between 
thoughts, feelings and behaviours, 27   32  but this study showed 
that group CBT can pursue individual goal-setting in subgroups, 
and still improve fatigue and well-being. In this intervention the size and composition of groups, and interactions between par-ticipants varied, yet adjusting for group made no difference to the ﬁ ndings. 
 This study lends support to the theory that complex inter-
actions between disease, personal context, cognitions and 
behaviours drive fatigue (and thus its impact), 
23  as a range of 
health beneﬁ  ts resulted from group CBT for RA fatigue, deliv-
ered by CB therapists. In clinical practice, interventions must be delivered pragmatically and efﬁ  ciently. Embedding such an intervention within the clinical rheumatology team is essential, given that trained CB therapists are not readily available to most teams, and improving access to psychological therapies is rec-ommended. 
50  A developmental project is therefore exploring 
whether, after brief training in CB approaches, the usual clini-
cal team could lead this intervention using a detailed manual ( leading to a clinical trial).
