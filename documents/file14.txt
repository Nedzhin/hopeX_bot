Objective. Current patient-reported outcome measures of fatigue in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have limitations, provid-
ing only a global perspective. This study constructed a questionnaire (the Bristol RA Fatigue Multi-DimensionalQuestionnaire [BRAF-MDQ]) from 45 preliminary questions derived from analysis of patient interviews and surveys and
explored its structure for fatigue dimensions. The BRAF-MDQ and short BRAF numerical rating scales (NRS) and visual
analog scales (VAS) for severity, effect, and ability to cope with fatigue were evaluated for validity.Methods. Two hundred twenty-nine RA patients with fatigue (VAS score >5 of 10) completed preliminary BRAF and
comparator fatigue scales. Iterative analyses informed item removal or retention in the BRAF-MDQ and identiﬁcation ofsubscales (using Cronbach’s alpha for internal consistency and factor analysis to identify dimensions). The BRAF-MDQ
and short scales were tested in relation to potentially associated variables for criterion and construct validity (Spear-
man’s correlation).Results. The 20-item BRAF-MDQ had good internal consistency (Cronbach’s
/H9251/H115490.932), criterion validity (correlation
with other fatigue scales: r /H115490.643– 0.813), and construct validity (correlations with disability, mood, helplessness, and
pain: r /H115490.340 – 0.627). Factor analysis showed 4 distinct dimensions (physical fatigue, living with fatigue, cognition
fatigue, and emotional fatigue), which correlated well with the RA Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue scale (r /H11549
0.548 – 0.834). The BRAF VAS and NRS showed similar criterion and construct validity.Conclusion. The BRAF instruments include standardized NRS and VAS for fatigue severity, effect, and coping, are RA
speciﬁc, and have evidence to support validity. The BRAF-MDQ uniquely measures 4 separate dimensions, which mayfacilitate development of individually-tailored fatigue management programs.
INTRODUCTION
People with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) consider fatigue tobe an important physical and cognitive symptom that isoverwhelming, uncontrollable, unpredictable, unearned,
and affects every aspect of life, and it is experienced by upto 98% of patients (by 40% daily) (1–3). RA fatigue iscomplex and multicausal with components, such as pain,stress, depression, inﬂammation, and disability, that arelikely to contribute in varying degrees at different times(4). International consensus has recommended that RAfatigue should now be measured in all RA studies along-side the core set, using an instrument validated in RAfatigue (5).
When developing scales or instruments to measure pa-
tient-reported outcomes such as fatigue, it is essential toinclude the issues that are important to patients (6,7), andqualitative research suggests that RA fatigue is multidi-mensional (3,8,9). A systematic review identiﬁed only 6instruments with some evidence of validation in RA, noneof which were thoroughly grounded in the patient experi-
Dr. Nicklin’s work was supported in part by an unre-
stricted educational grant from GlaxoSmithKline and by theAbove and Beyond Charity, University Hospitals Bristol.

1559ence (10). Further, many visual analog scales (VAS) dif-
fered substantially in their wordings and timeframes, pre-venting comparisons between studies (10). Among the
conclusions made in the review was the need for work to
develop and validate a standardized VAS, and the need toensure that instruments capture the essence of fatigue inRA as experienced by patients, including its severity, its
impact, and the perceived ability of the patient to cope.
As ﬁrst steps to meeting this requirement and working in
close collaboration with patients, we used content andinductive thematic analysis of in-depth patient interviews
to identify appropriate language and experiences, focus
groups to develop appropriate wording for VAS and nu-merical rating scales (NRS), and cognitive interviewingmethodology to explore understanding of candidate ques-
tions for a new RA fatigue scale. These approaches, fully
reported previously (11,12), are recommended by the USFood and Drug Administration (6,13). Patients’ proposalswere clariﬁed into draft versions of VAS and NRS for
fatigue severity, effect, and coping (the Bristol RA Fatigue
[BRAF] short scales [see Supplementary Appendix A,available in the online version of this article at http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/ 77005015/home]),
and a 45-item draft questionnaire that included 12 fatigue
categories derived from the qualitative analyses (cogni-
tion, coping, emotion, energy, frequency, impact, plan-ning, quality of life, relationships, severity, sleep, andsocial life). These categories are either not covered or notadequately covered in the 4 best-validated instruments
currently used in RA (10), the Functional Assessment of
Chronic Illness Therapy–Fatigue (FACIT-F) subscale (14),the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue (MAF) scale(15), the Proﬁle of Mood States (POMS) (16), and the ShortForm 36 (SF-36) vitality scale (17). Further, existing multi-
item fatigue questionnaires all produce a single, global
fatigue score (14 –21). However, if there are different di-mensions of fatigue, as suggested by our qualitative analy-ses (11,12), then an instrument that could identify and
score such dimensions separately would be advantageous.
Because of the way it was derived, we anticipated that thedraft BRAF questionnaire would be multidimensional.
The ﬁrst aim of the present study was therefore to eval-
uate whether the BRAF short scales correlate strongly with
existing fatigue instruments (evidence to support criterion
validity) and whether they correlate only moderately withrelated constructs of pain, disability, and mood (constructvalidity) (6,7,13,22). The second aim was to identify themost appropriate of the 45 items in the draft questionnaire
to form a coherent and internally consistent ﬁnal question-
naire; to explore it for robust, distinct, and consistentfatigue dimensions; and then to evaluate its criterion andconstruct validity.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Following research ethics committee approval, consecu-tive patients from the outpatient clinic of a large teachinghospital were invited to take part if they had a conﬁrmeddiagnosis of RA (23), were ages /H1135018 years, had English as
a ﬁrst language, and had a score /H113505 on a 10-cm fatigueVAS (ranging from no fatigue to extreme fatigue, adapted
from Crosby) (24). After giving informed consent, partici-pants completed the BRAF short scales, the draft 45-itemquestionnaire, and 4 existing comparator fatigue instru-
ments (for criterion validity), the FACIT-F, MAF, POMS,
and SF-36 vitality (14 –17). In order to evaluate constructvalidity, variables potentially associated with RA fatiguewere assessed: disability (the Health Assessment Ques-
tionnaire) (25,26), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale (27), the Arthritis Helplessness Index (28), and pain(10-cm VAS) (29). Two versions of the questionnaire book-let, one used at random for each patient, presented these indifferent orders to reduce potential order effect (30). Pa-tients completed their booklet without assistance fromresearch staff, either in the clinic or at home. Plasmaviscosity was recorded if taken for clinical reasons. Sam-
ple size was calculated on the basis of 5 patients per draft
questionnaire item for factor analysis (n /H11005225).
Data were analyzed using SPSS, versions 14 and 15
(SPSS), and because data were not normally distributed,Spearman’s correlations were used. For the draft question-
naire, iterative rounds of analyses allowed the removal of
less informative items and retention of more informativeitems. Cronbach’s alpha was used as the measure of inter-nal consistency and repeated factor analyses for the iden-
tiﬁcation of dimensions. Together with clinical judgment
concerning face validity, at each step the item appearing tocontribute least to the structure of the questionnaire wasremoved. When removal of further questions resulted in anoticeable reduction in Cronbach’s alpha or collapse of the
factor structure, the ﬁnal question structure was set. In
order to check the stability and robustness of the resultantfactors (dimensions) in the ﬁnal set of questions, repeatedfactor analyses were performed on 20 random samples of50% of the patients (bootstrapping). The ﬁnal question-
naire, the BRAF Multi-Dimensional Questionnaire (BRAF-
MDQ), was then evaluated for criterion and construct va-lidity using Spearman’s correlation in a similar way to thatundertaken for the VAS and NRS.
There are different opinions regarding the strength of the
correlation coefﬁcient (31–33). For the purposes of thiswork, correlations of r /H11005/H113500.7 are referred to as strong, r /H11005
/H110210.7 to r /H11005/H113500.5 as moderate, and r /H11005/H11021 0.5 as weak.
RESULTS
Four hundred twenty-eight patients with RA were invited
to complete the screening VAS, of whom 59 declined and95 scored /H110215 of 10 for fatigue. Of the 274 eligible patients,
249 consented to participate, 229 returned their booklets,
and 221 had completed the draft 45-item questionnaire(Figure 1). Patients reﬂected a wide range of personal anddisease characteristics (Tables 1 and 2). The MAF couldnot be calculated for 49 patients due to nonresponse to /H110222
questions (Tack BB: personal communication), giving a
MAF response rate of 78.6%.
Evaluation of the BRAF short scales. Mean VAS and
NRS scores for fatigue severity, effect, and coping areshown in Table 2. For each variable, the NRS and VAS1560 Nicklin et alversions correlated (r /H110050.784, r /H110050.777, and r /H110050.684 for
severity, effect, and coping, respectively), and although
the NRS version gave a slightly higher mean score, differ-ences between the two scales were not signiﬁcant andthere was no bias on Bland-Altman plots (34) (data notshown). The BRAF severity and effect scales correlated
with each other, but correlations between these and the
coping scale were weak, supporting the notion that copingwith RA fatigue is a new construct (Table 3).
The BRAF severity scale correlated strongly with the
MAF, FACIT-F, and POMS fatigue instruments, support-
ing criterion validity (Table 3), and correlated moderatelywith the SF-36 vitality subscale. There were only weakassociations with pain, disability, depression, and help-lessness, suggesting that the BRAF severity scale is asso-
ciated with but does not directly measure these constructs,
hence supporting construct validity. There was no corre-lation between the BRAF severity scale and inﬂammation.The BRAF effect scale correlated strongly with the MAFand POMS and moderately with FACIT-F and SF-36 vital-
ity, supporting criterion validity (Table 3). There were
only weak correlations with disability, helplessness,mood, and pain, supporting construct validity. For theBRAF coping scale there was only weak correlation withthe existing fatigue scales, further supporting the notionthat coping with RA fatigue is a construct not encom-passed within these scales. There were only weak cor-
relations between the coping scale and disability, help-less ness, mood, and pain, supporting construct validity.Table 1. Demographic data (n /H11549229)

Figure 1. Recruitment to study. VAS /H11005visual analog scale.Bristol RA Fatigue Multi-Dimensional Questionnaire 1561Perceived ability to cope with fatigue was not associated with
pain or inﬂammation. Thus, overall the BRAF short scaleswere correlated with other measures of fatigue (particularly
the MAF and POMS), but were not closely correlated with
other measures such as disability or mood. The BRAF coping(with RA fatigue) scale appears to measure an aspect offatigue not well captured by existing measures.
Question reduction to derive the BRAF-MDQ. Of the 45
draft questions, 5 were marked “Does not apply to me” by/H1102210% of participants and were therefore removed. Cron-
bach’s alpha on the remaining 40 questions was high (
/H9251/H11005
0.961), and initial factor analysis suggested 7 potentialdimensions. In an exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach’s
alpha calculated for each factor suggested that some items
contributed little, implying potential for item reduction.Therefore, calculations of Cronbach’s alpha and furtherfactor analyses were performed after the stepwise removalof 1 item at a time in a series of iterative rounds. After each
round, the question contributing the least (the “weakest”
question), as identiﬁed by Cronbach’s alpha and factoranalysis (tempered occasionally by clinical judgment),was removed. When removal of a question signiﬁcantlydisrupted factor structure and stability, it was reinserted
and the next weakest question removed. After 27 rounds, a
20-item questionnaire emerged that appeared to contain 4separate dimensions. The factor structure of the proposedﬁnal 20-item BRAF-MDQ was then tested for robustnessand stability in a further 20 rounds of factor analysis, eachusing a random subset of 50% of the patients (bootstrap-
ping). This ﬁnal 20-item BRAF-MDQ had excellent overallinternal consistency (
/H9251/H110050.932) and consistently showed
4 distinct dimensions (Table 4). After discussion with the
patient research partner (MU), the dimensions were given
formal labels: living ( /H9251/H110050.906), cognition ( /H9251/H110050.915),
emotion ( /H9251/H110050.889), and physical ( /H9251/H110050.713).
Two patient research partners were consulted regarding
the best order for the BRAF-MDQ dimensions and ques-tions. They proposed that the order should be physical (asit has a different layout) followed by living, cognition, andﬁnally emotion (as those questions may feel challenging[35]) (see Supplementary Appendix B, available in theonline version of this article at http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/77005015/home). The physical dimen-sion contains an NRS and questions on frequency andduration, but the response options to all other questionsare scored 0 –3 (where 0 /H11005not at all, 1 /H11005a little, 2 /H11005quite
a bit, and 3 /H11005very much). Simple summation yields a
global BRAF-MDQ score of 0 –70 (with higher scores indi-cating worse fatigue), whereas the score for each dimen-sion is different due to the varied number of questions(0 –22 for physical, 0 –21 for living, 0 –15 for cognition, and0 –12 for emotion) (see Supplementary Appendix C, avail-able in the online version of this article at http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/77005015/home). Ques-tions 1 and 2 are compulsory, and only 1 answer may bemissing from each dimension (maximum 3 missing an-swers in total). Missing data are replaced by calculatingTable 3.

Evaluation of the ﬁnal 20-item BRAF-MDQ. The global
and dimension BRAF-MDQ scores were calculated foreach patient. The mean /H11006SD scores were 38.4 /H1100613.7 for
global (maximum 70), 16.7 /H110064.0 for physical (maximum
22), 9.6 /H110065.5 for living (maximum 21), 6.1 /H110063.7 for
cognition (maximum 15), and 5.8 /H110063.4 for emotion (max-
imum 12). The distribution patterns for the global scoreand for each dimension differed (Figure 2), reinforcing the
notion that RA fatigue is not a single concept.
The BRAF-MDQ global score correlated strongly with
the MAF, POMS, and FACIT-F, supporting criterion valid-ity (Table 5), although the correlation with the SF-36 vi-tality subscale was weak. The global score correlated only
moderately with depression, anxiety, helplessness, and
disability, and correlated weakly with pain. These corre-lations provide supporting evidence for construct validityand are similar to those shown by existing fatigue instru-
ments. The BRAF-MDQ correlated slightly more strongly
with emotions (none of the existing instruments containquestions about emotions) but less strongly with pain(Table 5).Reviewing each of the BRAF-MDQ dimensions sepa-
rately, the physical dimension was correlated most
strongly with existing fatigue measures and other vari-
ables, living less so, emotion less so, and cognition theleast so (Table 5). The pattern of the correlations was asfollows: the physical dimension correlated weakly with all
variables, living correlated moderately with helplessness
and depression and weakly with pain, cognition correlatedweakly with anxiety, and emotion correlated moderatelywith anxiety and weakly with helplessness, disability, andpain. This broadly concurs with the overall character of
the BRAF-MDQ item content. When compared with the
BRAF short scales, the BRAF-MDQ physical dimensioncorrelated strongly with fatigue severity and moderately orweakly with effect and coping. Living correlated moder-
ately with both the effect and the severity short scales, but
weakly with the cognition short scale, and the emotiondimension had a similar pattern. The cognition dimensioncorrelated weakly with all of the short scales. These dif-
ferences reinforce the construction of the internal dimen-
sions of the BRAF-MDQ.
Exploratory analysis of the BRAF-MDQ. An explor-
atory analysis compared the BRAF-MDQ global fatigue
and individual fatigue dimensions between women andmen (using independent samples t-tests). Women showed
higher fatigue than men for physical fatigue, where the
mean/H11006SD scores were 17 /H110063.8 versus 15.7 /H110064.6 ( P/H11005
0.035), and emotional fatigue, where the mean /H11006SD scores
were 6.1 /H110063.2 versus 4.9 /H110063.6 ( P/H110050.024). In contrast,
there was no difference between the sexes for globalBRAF-MDQ (mean /H11006SD scores 39.1 /H110063.2 versus 36.1 /H11006
13.5; P/H110050.17), cognitive fatigue (mean /H11006SD scores
6.2/H110063.7 versus 5.8 /H110063.6; P/H110050.5), or living with fatigue
(9.7/H110065.3 versus 9.6 /H110065.4; P/H110050.9).
As an example of the different ways in which fatigue
might affect people, the varying experiences of 4 patients
(age range 40 –59 years) are illustrated in Figure 3 using the
BRAF short scales. Patients A and B (women) both hadsevere fatigue (score 9 of 10) with high effect scores (8 and9 of 10). However, whereas patient A perceived that she
could cope well (8 of 10, with higher scores indicating
better coping), patient B perceived that she could not cope(1 of 10). Patients C and D (men) both had moderatelysevere fatigue (6 of 10) with little effects on their lives (2and 3 of 10). However, whereas patient C would require no
support for coping (10 of 10), patient D still perceived that
his coping was not optimum (8 of 10) (Figure 3). Using theBRAF-MDQ, 2 female patients, for example, in the sameage range (40 –59 years) and with similar global scores(28,29), differed signiﬁcantly in their underlying dimen-
sions of fatigue, particularly for cognition and emotion,
with physical scores of 12 versus 16, living scores of 6versus 5, cognition scores of 3 versus 6, and emotionscores of 8 versus 1.

of the development of such instruments (11,12), we re-
ported how the wording and questions were chosen to
capture the patient perspective using interviews, focusgroups, and cognitive interviewing as the recommendedbest practice (6,7,13). The draft versions of short scales
that emerged (11) have been shown in the current study to
have construct and criterion validity, and a 20-item mul-tidimensional questionnaire (the BRAF-MDQ) derivedfrom the draft questions has been shown to include 4dimensions of RA fatigue, which we have termed physical,
living, cognition, and emotion.
Global BRAF-MDQ scores correlated only moderately
with anxiety, depression, helplessness, and disability, andcorrelated weakly with pain, suggesting that the BRAF-MDQ score is associated with but does not directly mea-
sure these constructs. It correlated strongly with existing
fatigue instruments but has the advantage of assessingfatigue in 4 dimensions. The physical dimension corre-lated strongly with the existing fatigue instruments, whichalso appear to measure the physical severity of fatigue.

† Higher scores indicate better outcome.Bristol RA Fatigue Multi-Dimensional Questionnaire 1565the existing fatigue instruments, includes questions that
relate to the unpredictability of RA fatigue, which makesfulﬁlling roles and planning life difﬁcult, potentially lead-
ing to poor self-image and self-identity (36). It correlated
moderately with measures of depression and helplessness.The emergence of a robust cognition dimension for RAfatigue reﬂects a feature that many patients report (3,8,9),
yet which is not measured in existing fatigue instruments.
Cognitive effects are important as they may lead to errors,lack of concentration, and suboptimal performance, im-pacting on function and work (3,9,37,38). The cognition
dimension correlated only weakly or moderately with the
existing fatigue instruments and weakly with other vari-ables, suggesting that it is capturing a unique concept offatigue that is also different from pain, disability, or mood.
The emotion dimension also acknowledges an area of fa-
tigue measurement that has been neglected. It correlatedweakly or moderately with the other fatigue instrumentsand with anxiety and helplessness. Higher correlations
would have indicated that the BRAF-MDQ was actually
measuring these constructs rather than acknowledgingthem, and lower correlations would have suggested noassociation between fatigue, emotion, and mood, whichwould have been illogical. There was only a weak correlation
between the emotion dimension and the POMS (a fatigue
mood instrument), but the POMS is not RA speciﬁc.
This study has demonstrated that it is possible to iden-
tify different dimensions of RA fatigue. This is supportedby a recent study by Pollard et al, in which questions from
several existing fatigue questionnaires completed by pa-
tients with RA were combined into a single, large-factoranalysis. Five potential dimensions emerged: severity,anxiety/depression (psychological factors), distress/cogni-tion, physical interference, and social interference (39).
These broad categories reﬂect the 4 dimensions of the
BRAF-MDQ.
Fries et al recommend that outcomes should be mea-
sured in the patient’s value system (25). The strength of the
BRAF-MDQ lies in its development from the patient per-
spective, with every phrase, question, and dimensiongrounded in the fatigue that is experienced by patients, ascaptured through interviews, focus groups, and cognitivetesting (11,12). The wording came from patients, ensuring
that it is understandable. Complex wording and phrasing
can be difﬁcult to comprehend (40,41). Questions that areeasy to understand may perform better, reducing the sam-ple sizes required for trials because there will be fewermissing data (40). For the only existing RA-speciﬁc fatigue
instrument (the MAF), 20% of returned questionnaires
could not be scored because of missing data, a ﬁnding alsoreported by others (42).
Although VAS and NRS have been used to measure
fatigue severity prior to this study, no standardized word-
ing had been developed or evaluated to our knowledge.We concluded from our earlier studies (11,12) that mea-suring severity in isolation does not give the full picture ofthe patient fatigue experience; therefore, VAS and NRSwere also developed in this study to measure the per-ceived effects and ability to cope with fatigue. Our resultsindicate satisfactory criterion and construct validity of theBRAF short scales for severity, effect, and coping. The data
also demonstrate a potential disconnect between the abil-ity to cope with fatigue and its severity, which offers thepossibility that patients might be able to improve theirability to cope with fatigue and thus reduce its effect, evenif fatigue severity per se cannot be changed (Figure 3).
A lengthy questionnaire is not always necessary or de-
sirable, and a short, 1-page scale comprising all 3 BRAF
short scales may be all that is required at a routine con-sultation as a screening tool to gain an understanding ofthe main fatigue issues (43). A single-item VAS for fatigue
performs equally as well as existing longer questionnaires
that give global scores, and patients prefer brevity (44).This current study suggests that the BRAF VAS and NRSare equally valid, which supports previous research inother symptoms (45– 47). However, the NRS scoredslightly higher than the VAS, which means that they arenot interchangeable (47,48). Although the BRAF VAS andNRS short scales performed in similar ways, there are
practical reasons for recommending the NRS versions.
NRS are easier and quicker to score, and some patients ﬁndthe concept of VAS difﬁcult to understand, and annotatewith words or sentences (45).
The advantage of the 20-item BRAF-MDQ is that insight
can be gained into the different dimensions of fatigue,
enabling the exploration of different predictors and inter-ventions for each dimension. In addition, the differentdimensions of the BRAF-MDQ, perhaps used in conjunc-tion with the BRAF coping NRS, may allow patient-spe-
ciﬁc self-management strategies to be developed and en-
couraged. The BRAF scales therefore have the potential tochange the way that fatigue is managed for individualpatients, leading to improved quality of life.
Evaluation of instruments is a continuous process, and
further evaluation of the BRAF instruments is required fortest–retest reliability, sensitivity to change, and minimumclinically important differences (49). For other fatigue se-verity VAS used in RA, a minimum clinically important
difference of 10% has been calculated (50). The BRAF
instruments could also be evaluated for relevance in otherrheumatologic conditions, which might allow comparisonacross conditions.
The development and evaluation of the BRAF-MDQ,
with its clear dimensions of physical fatigue, living, cog-
nition, and emotion, represents an important step forwardin our understanding of RA fatigue. The BRAF-MDQ andBRAF short scales together provide the tools for under-
standing the quality of the patient’s fatigue experience for
comparison across studies, offer an opportunity to explorepredictors or causal pathways for different fatigue dimen-sions, and enable clinicians to individualize the teachingof self-management strategies according to patient proﬁles
and target interventions, as well as providing tools for
assessing the effectiveness of those interventions.
