Fatigue, the enduring sensation of weakness, lack of energy, 
tiredness or exhaustion, is described by 40%–80% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis as their most disabling symptom 
with wide-ranging consequences for quality of life. Little 
attention has been paid to its multidimensional nature or to its reliability as a measure to evaluate progression of the disease. Low impact aerobic exercise affects the level of 
fatigue, and this same level of fatigue influences the exercise 
itself. We searched Medline, Cochrane Collaboration Register of Controlled Trials (CCRCT), Lilacs, PubMed and Scopus databases for randomized controlled trials (with appropriate description of methods, materials and results) on the 
assessment of fatigue and exercise. Review articles, case 
reports, letters to the editor and editorials were excluded. Of 121 references initially identified, 4  randomized controlled 
trials met the inclusion criteria. Two studies used the MAF 
scale (Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue), one used 
the MAC (Mental Adjustment to Cancer) fatigue scale, and all trials used POMS (Profile of Mood States) to assess fatigue. All four trials conducted a 12 week program of two to three times/week and different periods of follow-up. Two studies used low 
impact aerobic exercise, one used dance-based exercise, and 
another study followed a home cardiopulmonary conditioning program using a stationary bicycle. While fatigue appears to be a reliable outcome measure in the clinical management of 
RA, especially when related to exercise prescription, further 
research is needed to evaluate the correlation between exercise, fatigue and quality of life, using fatigue scales validated to explore the different components of fatigue and its wide-ranging consequences.

Fatigue is the enduring sensation of weakness, lack of 
energy, tiredness or exhaustion, reported by 40%–80% of 
rheumatoid arthritis patients as their most disabling symptom [1-3]. Unlike normal tiredness, fatigue is chronic, typically not related to overexertion and poorly relieved by rest. It is often multifactorial and could be worsened by disease-related 
components, including comorbid conditions, disease duration, 
functional status, disease activity, lifestyle factors, level of activ-ity, and inadequate social support [1-3].
Because it is regarded as an extra-articular symptom, little 
attention has been paid to its multidimensional nature and 
its wide-ranging effects on quality of life. Until recently, the 
significance of fatigue for patients failed to capture the atten-tion of many clinicians, with patients reporting a lack of sup-
port from health professionals who relate mainly to physical 
problems and disease activity. Moreover, patients sometimes 
believe nothing can be done and do not talk to their physician 
about fatigue [4,5].
Unlike pain and disability, fatigue is rarely addressed as 
a treatment target in its own right and is seldom recom-mended as a main outcome for clinical trials. The OMERACT (Outcome Measures in Rheumatology) network of interna-
tional researchers highlighted fatigue as a main outcome and 
recommended that it be measured whenever possible [4].
Fatigue was identified as a reliable distinguisher of 
quality 
of life between RA1 patients who are doing well and those who 
are doing less well. According to Minnock et al. [6], fatigue is 
a valid and reliable outcome measure in RA, ranking third for 
relative sensitivity to change after pain and tender-joint count. 
They also found fatigue to be an independent measure of out-
come and recommended that it be considered for inclusion as a main outcome measure in RA [4,6].
There are several scales to assess fatigue but only a few are val -
idated as reliable tools. Hewlett and colleagues [7] conducted a 
systematic review of the scales used to measure fatigue in RA and 
the evidence for their validation. They found 23 fatigue scales 
of which 17 had no data on validation or limited evidence. Six 
scales showed reasonable evidence of validation: two are generic, namely POMS (Profile of Mood States) and SF-36 (Medical 
Outcomes Study 36-item Form Health Survey), and four are spe-
cific, MAF (Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue), Ordinal Scales, V AS (Visual Analogue Scale) and FACIT-F (Functional 
Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue) [7].

Historically, exercise in general was prescribed for pain 
relief and improvement of joint mobility and flexibility. In 
recent decades exercise has increasingly been directed towards 
improving muscle strength and 
aerobic capacity in order to enhance 
functional ability and quality of life. Reduced function will result in 
decreased ability to perform activities of daily living, decreased 
independence, and adoption of a sedentary lifestyle with its resultant negative psychosocial impact and increased risk for 
cardiovascular disease [8].
The 2012 Brazilian consensus group for RA recommends 
aerobic exercise such as cycling, walking, running and swim-ming. They advise exercise of 20 minutes or more at least 
twice a week, but limited to 60% of the heart rate based on the 
patient’s age [9]. It is currently accepted that regular exercise 
can improve aerobic fitness, increase strength and alleviate pain in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases [2]. However, 
fatigue is rarely assessed as an outcome measure [10-12].
Given that fatigue in RA affects quality of life, functional 
capacity and daily activity, and that exercise can reduce pain and fatigue levels, once the latter is evaluated as an outcome 
measure to prescribe exercise (its type and/or duration), we reviewed the assessment of fatigue as an outcome measure and 
a predictor of exercise in rheumatoid arthritis. For the period 
August to October 2012, Medline (1985–2012), the Cochrane 
Collaboration Register of Controlled Trials (CCRCT), Lilacs, 
Pubmed (1985–2012), and Scopus databases were searched in Portuguese, English, Spanish, French and Italian. The key-
words used in the search were rheumatoid arthritis, fatigue, 
fitness, physical activity, and exercise. Inclusion criteria were 
randomized controlled trials (with appropriate description of 
methods, materials and results) on the assessment of fatigue and exercise. Review articles, case reports, letters to the editor 
and editorials were excluded. 
The title and abstract of the articles obtained in the initial 
research were revised by two independent observers in order to identify those that met the inclusion criteria. The articles 
selected were then revised, and their bibliographical references 
were analyzed to identify additional sources.Of the selected 
articles, the following data were examined: type of study, size of the sample, methods, statistical analysis, and results. The meth-
odological quality of the papers was evaluated with the Jadad 
scale, comprising three items quantifying the probability of bias in the trial according to the description of randomization, 
masking, withdrawals and dropouts. Scores range from 1 to 5, 
with studies scoring 1 or 2 considered of low quality and those 
scoring 3 to 5 of high quality [12].
Of the 121 references initially identified in the cited data-
bases, 37 were duplicates and 69 were considered irrelevant. Of the remaining 15 references 11 were excluded because they did 
not fulfill the inclusion criteria, leaving 4 randomized controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria. Figure 1 is a flow chart 
of reference selection. Using the Jadad scale, evaluation of the 
trials ranged from 2 to 5 (0–2 low quality, 3–5 high quality) 
with an average quality score of 3.25. One of the selected papers scored 5 [13], another scored 4 [10] and two 
studies scored 2 [14,15].
 A total of 
311 patients were evaluated in the trials, the mean number of patients in each trial was 77 (range 25–220), and the mean age 
ranged from 39 to 55.5 years. Table 1 presents a description of 
the patients.
All four articles evaluated the effects of exercise intervention 
on fatigue, assessing the latter as an outcome measure. Three scales were used to assess fatigue: the MAF
2 [10,13] in two stud-
ies, the MAC3 [15] in two, and the POMS4 in all [Table 2]. All 
four trials conducted a 12 week program of 2 to 3 times/week and different periods of follow-up. Two studies involved low 
impact aerobic exercise (with one foot always on the ground and 
no running or jumping movements) [10,13], one used dance-
based exercise [14], and one followed a home cardiopulmonary

[6]. It should be recognized that fatigue is a common complaint 
in primary care, with a broad differential diagnosis – from phys-
ical to psychological – rendering its approach complex and difficult 
to treat [16].
The present review aimed to 
analyze trials assessing fatigue as an outcome measure and a pre-
dictor of exercise in rheumatoid arthritis. The research yielded 
four papers meeting the inclusion criteria. The results showed 
reasonable evidence that the effects of exercise on fatigue are 
dose-related, although not statistically significant. It also shows conditioning program using a stationary bicycle [14]. Table 3 describes the protocol and scales employed in each study.
Neuberger et al. [13] and Daltroy et al. [15] established the 
target heart rate as 60–80% of the maximal heart rate achieved 
at baseline, while Noreau et al. [14] fixed the target heart rate 
at 50% of the maximal heart rate for the first 3 weeks, and 70% of the maximal heart rate for the last 9 weeks. Neuberger et al. 
[10] did not evaluate heart rate at baseline, nor did they affix a 
specific value to it.
Statistical analysis of change in the perception of fatigue in 
all studies, using POMS, MAF and/or MAC scales, showed a decrease in fatigue levels. Although statistical significance was 
not obtained (0.03 ≤ P ≤ 0.10), the results provide reasonable 
evidence that fatigue could influence exercise prescription (type of exercise and/or duration) and that the effects of exercise on 
fatigue are dose-related. 
All trials were described as randomized, but only one study 
explained how the subjects were randomly allocated. The initial status was documented, and a homogeneity test was performed 
in all studies. Follow-up was completed in all studies, and sub-
jects who were withdrawn from the study or who dropped out 
were documented.
ratiOnale
Several studies have evaluated the effects of exercise on fatigue, but 
only a few assessed it as an outcome measure. There are also 
several instruments to assess fatigue; some are brief, quantita-
tive and symptom-focused, while others are multidimensional. 
However, only six scales show reasonable evidence of validation Further studies should compare the 
available questionnaires and scales 
with the current core set measures to 
determine which better assesses fatigue 
in its multidimensional aspectstable 2. Sample, protocol and scales used

sure for the prescription of physical activity. 
On the other hand, the review shows a lack of studies with 
rigorous random sampling selection and blinding (single or 
double blinded), and the articles analyzed do not provide suffi-
cient data to answer many questions with reliability. Future stud-ies should provide the missing data, such as the type of training 
(i.e., strength training), as well as the average frequency, inten-
sity and duration of the exercise intervention. Also required are more complete data on compliance with the exercise pro-
tocol. The issue of dose response is important given the recent 
recommendations from the Physical Activity Guidelines for 
Americans calling for additional dose-response analyses [17]. 
cOnclusiOns
There is a lack of studies assessing fatigue as an outcome mea-
sure of patients with RA doing exercise; but the articles ana-
lyzed provide reasonable evidence that fatigue can be used both 
as a main measure in RA and as a good predictor of physical 
activity. Although there are several questionnaires and scales 
available to evaluate fatigue, clinical trials should be conducted to compare these tools with the current core set measures to 
determine which better assesses fatigue in its multidimensional 
aspects. Finally, fatigue appears to be a reliable outcome mea-sure in the clinical management of RA, especially with regard 
to exercise prescription. However, there is a need for further 
research to evaluate the correlation between exercise, fatigue 
and quality of life, using validated fatigue scales, such as those 
described by Hewlett et al. [6] to explore the different compo-nents of fatigue and its wide-ranging consequences.
