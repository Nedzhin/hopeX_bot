RESEARCH
Fatigue is associated with disease 
activity in some, but not all, patients living 
with rheumatoid arthritis: disentangling 
“between-person” and “within-person” 
associations

Abstract 
Background: Previous research has shown an unclear and inconsistent association between fatigue and disease 
activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of this study was to explore differences in “between-person” 
and “within-person” associations between disease activity parameters and fatigue severity in patients with established 
RA.
Methods: Baseline and 3-monthly follow-up data up to one-year were used from 531 patients with established RA 
randomized to stopping (versus continuing) tumor necrosis factor inhibitor treatment enrolled in a large pragmatic 
trial. Between- and within-patient associations between different indicators of disease activity (C-reactive protein 
[CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], swollen and tender joint count [ SJC and TJC], visual analog scale general 
health [VAS-GH]) and patient-reported fatigue severity (Bristol RA Fatigue Numerical Rating Scale) were disaggregated 
and estimated using person-mean centering in combination with repeated measures linear mixed modelling.
Results: Overall, different indices of disease activity were weakly to moderately associated with fatigue severity over 
time (β’s from 0.121 for SJC to 0.352 for VAS-GH, all p’s < 0.0001). Objective markers of inflammation (CRP , ESR and 
SJC) were associated weakly with fatigue within patients over time (β’s: 0.104–0.142, p’s < 0.0001), but not between 
patients. The subjective TJC and VAS-GH were significantly associated with fatigue both within and between patients, 
but with substantially stronger associations at the between-patient level (β’s: 0.217–0.515, p’s < 0.0001). Within-person 
associations varied widely for individual patients for all components of disease activity.
Conclusion: Associations between fatigue and disease activity vary largely for different patients and the pattern of 
between-person versus within-person associations appears different for objective versus subjective components of 
disease activity. The current findings explain the inconsistent results of previous research, illustrates the relevance of 
statistically distinguishing between different types of association in research on the relation between disease activity 
and fatigue and additionally suggest a need for a more personalized approach to fatigue in RA patients.

Background
Fatigue, although prioritized by patients, is a poorly 
understood symptom of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
Fatigue is reported by almost 90% of patients with RA 
and around 40% of patients report clinically impor -
tant levels of fatigue or severe fatigue [1 , 2]. Qualita -
tive research among RA patients with severe fatigue 
suggests that their fatigue is different from normal 
tiredness and is perceived by them as having far reach -
ing consequences for all domains of daily life, by being 
intrusive and overwhelming [3 ]. Many patients pri -
oritize fatigue as an important health outcome [4 , 5] 
and therefore fatigue is now a core outcome measure 
in RA studies [6 , 7]. Rheumatologists acknowledge the 
prevalence and impact of fatigue in their RA patients 
as 93% of the respondents of a questionnaire sent to 
rheumatologisst and trainees indicate that fatigue 
should still be considered a problem for patients even 
if pain is successfully resolved [8 ]. Despite this, fatigue 
is rarely a treatment target. This is mainly due to the 
lack of knowledge about the (patho)physiology of 
fatigue and the role of RA, in particular disease activ -
ity [9 ]. Although RA patients generally mention their 
disease as the cause of their fatigue [10], for markers of 
inflammation and other indicators of disease activity, 
an unclear and inconsistent relationship with fatigue in 
RA has been shown. Some studies, showing a signifi -
cant relation, contrast other studies in which inflam -
matory markers did not contribute to the severity of 
fatigue at all [11, 12]. Although treatment with bio -
logicals comes with reduction of fatigue in RA [9 , 13], 
the actual group-level effects of biologicals on fatigue 
appears to be small [14]. Moreover, the reduction of 
fatigue is driven by improvements in pain and depres -
sion, and not by changes in inflammatory activity [15].
Our current understanding of the relation between 
fatigue in RA and disease activity is limited by the 
fact that, up to present, studies have been either small 
and cross-sectional or longitudinal with only a limited 
number of observations per patient [12]. Importantly, 
cross-sectional studies are by design only able to exam -
ine so-called “between-person” associations. As such, 
these studies only examined if patients with higher dis -
ease activity than others also experienced more fatigue. 
Listening to patients and their physicians, that fatigue 
and its relationship with RA differs between per -
sons, demands for methodologies that can distinguish 
“between-person” from “within-person” associations. 
Such “within-person”  relations over time describe what happens with fatigue within individual patients when 
their disease activity changes.
Most theories about the mechanisms that underlie 
specific associations between variables of interest, such 
as disease activity and fatigue, but also interventions 
targeting such variables, are based on processes that are 
assumed to take place within persons [16, 17]. So, they 
assume that changing one variable leads to changes in 
the other variable within people. Results from “between-
person” analysis, such as those from cross-sectional stud -
ies, can only be generalized to “within-person” relations 
when strict assumptions of statistical “ergodicity” are 
met [18, 19]. However, it has been convincingly demon -
strated that these assumptions are rarely met, and that 
“between-person” relations can be quite different from 
“within-person” relations both in magnitude and some -
times even in direction [16–20]: an observation referred 
to as Simpson’s paradox [21]. For instance, our study 
examining the association between disease activity and 
radiographic progression in RA patients showed that dif -
ferent indices of disease activity were not or only weakly 
associated at the “between-patient” level, but more often 
and more strongly associated within individual patients 
over time [22].
Cross-sectional or even standard longitudinal analy -
ses do not allow for examining within-person associa -
tions, since the latter also mix both between-person and 
within-person results. Instead, specific statistical analysis 
methods of longitudinal data are needed that can distin -
guish the multiple sources of information, such as multi -
level (hierarchical) mixed models [16, 17, 19, 20, 23, 24]. 
Although disaggregating “within-person” and “between-
person” effects is increasingly used in other fields, it has 
been scarcely used in medicine and up to present not for 
studying the relationship between fatigue and disease 
activity in RA. More detailed knowledge on the type of 
association between different indicators of disease activ -
ity and fatigue may shed light on the apparent incon -
sistent relationships found in previous studies and is 
mandatory to develop a theoretical framework for fatigue 
in RA [12]. If between-person associations are indeed 
different from within-person associations, this can also 
have relevant implications for improving treatment of RA 
fatigue as it may allow future identification of individual 
patients or groups of patients with different patterns of 
associations between disease activity and fatigue.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the 
“between-person” and “within-person” association of dis -
ease activity indices and fatigue severity in patients with Keywords: Rheumatoid arthritis, Disease activity, Fatigue, Within-patients associations, Between-patients associationsPage 3 of 9

established stable RA, who were asked to withdraw their 
treatment with a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi).
Methods
Patients and study design
Data were used from the Potential Optimalisation of 
Expediency and Effectiveness of TNFi’s (POET trial), 
registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR3112) 
[25, 26]. Ethical approval for this multicenter study 
was granted by the Committee on Research Involving 
Human Subjects, region Arnhem—Nijmegen (Com -
missie Mensgebonden Onderzoek, regio Arnhem—
Nijmegen). Local feasibility was approved by the Ethical 
Committees of all participating hospitals. In this prag -
matic open-label trial, adult patients with established RA 
and stable low disease activity (28-joint Disease Activity 
Score [DAS28] < 3.2) for at least 6  months were rand -
omized in a 2:1 ratio to stop or continue treatment with 
their current TNFi and followed up for one year. Con -
comitant treatment with conventional synthetic disease-
modifying antirheumatic drugs was continued. In case 
of flare (DAS28 ≥ 3.2 with an increase > 0.6) [27], TNFi 
could be restarted at the discretion of the rheumatologist. 
In total, 817 patients were included in the POET trial. All 
analyses in the current study were performed using the 
data from the discontinuation group (N = 531) since this 
treatment arm contained the most patients and more 
changes in both disease activity and fatigue was observed 
in this group over time.
Assessments
Patients’ disease activity was evaluated at the outpatient 
clinic by their treating rheumatologist and rheumatology 
nurse at baseline and at least every three months thereaf -
ter, for a period of one year. Additionally, patients com -
pleted patient-reported outcome measurements every 
three months, including fatigue.
Disease activity
Disease activity measurements included the erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (ESR, mm/hour), C-reactive protein 
level (CRP , mg/dl), 28 tender and swollen joint counts 
(TJC and SJC), and a patient-reported assessment of gen -
eral health on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS-GH). 
ESR, joint counts and the VAS-GH were used to calculate 
the composite DAS28-ESR [28].
Fatigue severity
The Bristol RA Fatigue (BRAF) scales [29, 30] were used 
to measure different dimensions of fatigue at the defined 
timepoints. For compatibility with previous studies, 
that most used single-item scales for fatigue severity or 
intensity, the numerical rating scale for fatigue severity (BRAF-NRS Severity) was used for all analyses. The 
BRAF-NRS Severity measures the average level of fatigue 
during the past 7 days on an 0–10 NRS anchored by “no 
fatigue” (0) to “totally exhausted” [10]. The BRAF-NRS 
Severity scale has demonstrated both strong reliabil -
ity and adequate sensitivity to change [31]. The patient 
acceptable symptom state for 0–10 fatigue NRSs has 
been estimated to be around 4 on average in different RA 
populations [32, 33].
Data analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 
Statistics version 26. Means of disease activity and fatigue 
scores were estimated and analysed using repeated meas -
ures linear mixed model analyses with time as a fixed 
covariate. Person-mean centering in combination with 
multilevel mixed modeling was used to separate within-
patient associations between disease activity and fatigue 
from between-patient associations [17, 19, 20, 24]. For 
this, disease activity scores at each time-point were 
within-subject centered by subtracting the patient’s mean 
disease activity score across all available time-points 
from each observed value from that patient at the dif -
ferent time points. Within-subject centering effectively 
eliminates all between-subject variance, thus allowing to 
distinguish within-person effects from between-person 
effects in longitudinal models [17].
In the first series of models, observed disease activ -
ity values were entered as fixed time-varying covariates 
in repeated-measures linear mixed models with fatigue 
severity at each time point as dependent variable and 
patient intercept as random effect. In these models, the 
resulting regression estimate represents an aggregation 
(or unknow “blend”) of both the between-person and 
within-person effects of time-varying disease activity val -
ues on fatigue [17]. In the next series of models, person-
mean disease activity (for between-person association) 
across all observations and time-varying person-mean 
centered disease activity at each observation (for within-
person association) were simultaneously entered as fixed 
covariates. This procedure statistically separates any 
between-person association from within-person asso -
ciations. The resulting person-mean regression estimate 
for disease activity indicates the extent to which patients’ 
mean disease activity scores are associated with fatigue 
(i.e., do patients with on average high disease activity 
report more severe fatigue at the different time points?). 
In contrast, the person-mean centered regression esti -
mate indicates the extent to which patients’ deviations 
from their average (or typical) disease activity are associ -
ated with more or less fatigue at that that time point.
In all models person-mean centered disease activity 
scores, person-mean disease activity scores and fatigue Page 4 of 9 Versteeg et al. BMC Rheumatol             (2022) 6:3 
severity scores were additionally converted to Z-scores 
to obtain standardized regression estimates (β) alongside 
unstandardized estimates from the mixed models. Stand -
ardized estimates were interpreted with Cohen’s [34] 
guidelines for small, medium, and large effect sizes (0.10, 
0.30, and 0.50, respectively). Separate mixed models were 
estimated for composite DAS28-ESR scores and each 
of the individual disease activity parameters (ESR, CRP , 
TJC, SJC and VAS-GH) as fixed covariates. All models 
were estimated using the restricted maximum likelihood 
method and a compound symmetry covariance structure 
was used for the repeated measurements as this best fit -
ted the data based on log-likelihood ratio tests across the 
different models. Between-patient and within-patient 
associations were illustrated using the ggplots2 package 
in R.
Results
Patient characteristics
Table  1 presents the baseline characteristics of the 
patients included in the TNFi discontinuation group. 
Patients were mostly female with a mean age of 60 years 
and on average longstanding disease. Baseline dis -
ease activity was low (DAS28 < 3.2), and the majority of 
patients reported a BRAF-NRS fatigue severity score < 4.
Both disease activity scores (including all individual 
DAS-28 components) and fatigue scores significantly 
increased (all time effect p ’s < 0.001) after stopping 
TNFi (Fig.  1). In total, 51.2% of the patients experi -
enced a disease activity flare and almost half of the patients (47.5%) restarted their TNFi within 12 months 
after discontinuation.
Aggregate associations between disease activity 
and fatigue
Composite DAS28-ESR scores were significantly, 
but only weakly, associated over time in ’aggregated’ 
(or blended) between- and within-patient analysis 
(β = 0.274, p < 0.0001). Aggregate associations for the 
separate parameters of disease activity were also weak 
for CRP and ESR values and the SJC and TJC, but 
medium for the VAS-GH (Table 2 ).Table 1 Baseline characteristics of the patients in the

Disaggregated between‑patient and within‑patient 
associations
Disaggregated analysis showed that at the group level 
DAS28-ESR scores were significantly associated both 
between patients and within patients over time (Table  3). 
This indicates that patients with on average higher dis -
ease activity than other patients, also report more fatigue 
than other patients. In addition to this between-person 
effect, within individual patients increases in disease 
activity from their own mean were also associated with 
more severe fatigue.
Both types of association were, however, only weak 
in magnitude. The low overall within-person associa -
tion is illustrated in Fig.  2 (lower panel), showing a large 
variability in individual regression lines. Many patients 
showed strong positive associations between changes in 
disease activity and fatigue over time, but many patients 
also demonstrated no or even negative associations.
For the individual parameters of disease activity, a 
consistent difference between the objective and sub -
jective parameters emerged (Table  3). Objective indi -
cators of disease activity (CRP , ESR and SJC) were 
associated weakly within patients over time (β’s: 0.104–
0.142, p’s < 0.0001), but not between patients. This 
indicates that changes in these markers in individual 
patients were associated with increased fatigue, but that 
patients with on average higher disease activity than 
other patients did not report more fatigue over time. In contrast, the TJC and VAS-GH were significantly associ -
ated both within and between patients, but with substan -
tially stronger associations at the between-patient level. 
Especially the VAS-GH was strongly associated with 
fatigue between patients (β = 0.515, p < 0.0001) but only 
weakly within patients (β = 0.167, p < 0.0001). As with the 
composite DAS28-ESR scores, substantial individual dif -
ferences were in the associations between separate dis -
ease activity parameters and fatigue (Fig. 3).
Overall, the segregated analyses confirmed that 
DAS28-ESR scores and fatigue are weakly associated 
both between- and within patients over time, but that 
these associations are quite different for both different 
patients and for different components of disease activity.
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated that in RA patients dis -
ease activity is related to their fatigue. However, this 
relation is highly individual and may also be absent of 
negative in some patients. In addition, the relationship is 
different for the individual components of disease activ -
ity. Associations between subjective measures of disease 
activity and fatigue mostly reflect more stable between-
patient differences, whereas objective markers of inflam -
mation show significant positive associations only within 
patients.
Biomedically, a positive association between fatigue 
and disease activity can be explained by activity of the

inflammatory process that comes with acute phase reac -
tions and stimulation of cytokines and inflammatory 
cells. Also, fatigue in active RA can be the understand -
able consequence of the increased energy requirement in 
physical activities due to painful and swollen joints com -
bined with muscle weakness [35]. From this pathophysi -
ology, fatigue in RA patients with high disease activity 
can be reduced by successful suppression of inflamma -
tion. However, persistent fatigue in some RA patients 
with low levels of objective disease activity seems to sug -
gest a mechanism independent from inflammation. It is 
hypothesized that several behavioral, psychological and 
cognitive mechanisms drive this process in a complex 
way [ 36]. This is reflected in a biopsychosocial model in 
which it is assumed that factors are to be involved to var -
ying degrees in individual patients and that these factors 
influence each other in diverse ways in different patients. 
Physical functioning, poor mental status, sleep distur -
bance, pain, depression and anxiety have often been 
found to be independent variables associated with fatigue 
in multivariate analyses [37]. Hewlett et al. also proposed 
a dynamic model with bidirectional interactions between disease processes, cognitive and behavioural factors and 
personal life issues and assumed the influence of this fac -
tors to vary between individuals and within individuals at 
different times [38].
The use of different (composite) indicators of disease 
activity and analyses, which do not distinguish between 
associations between persons and within persons, may 
have led to the conflicting results in earlier research. The 
results of the analysis used in our study, which separate 
between-patients and within-patients associations, may 
explain why these previous studies generally found either 
weaker or contradictory associations between disease 
activity and fatigue. In our study, we included the results 
of the aggregated and disaggregated analysis to show 
what happens when within-person and between-person 
associations are statistically separated. The results con -
firm the varying relationship between different disease 
activity measures and fatigue both between and within 
individuals. Our study shows a weak significant asso -
ciation between fatigue and the objective components of 
disease activity, e.g., inflammation, within individuals and 
even no significant association of these factors between 
individuals. Additionally, we have clearly illustrated that 
the within person association between inflammation and 
fatigue varies widely between individual patients from 
strong and positive to absent or even negative.
The stronger association between fatigue and the sub -
jective components of disease activity, e.g., tender joints 
and general health, between persons may, although not 
directly inferred from the current study, support the idea 
that fatigue may be a more common symptom of chronic 
disease rather than a disease-specific symptom. In par -
ticular, patients’ perceived general health will to some 
extent depend on factors that are not always disease spe -
cific. Menting et al., already demonstrated that variance 
in fatigue severity in different chronic diseases, includ -
ing RA, can largely be explained by non-disease-specific 
factors like sex, age, motivational and concentration 
problems, pain, sleep disturbance, physical functioning, 
reduced activity and lower self-efficacy [39]. They there -
fore argued for a transdiagnostic approach that focuses 
on the individual patient’s needs.
Given the various disease-specific and non-disease-
specific factors that influence fatigue, the approach to 
this important patient reported symptom will have to 
be multidimensional. Proper multidimensional man -
agement of fatigue starts by making it an important 
topic for discussion during the consultation between 
patient and healthcare professional. Although many 
patients report fatigue as a major symptom, it is not 
structurally communicated at the rheumatology out -
patient clinic. It has been demonstrated that fatigue 
was communicated in only 6% of the total consultation

time and that in most cases the patient initiated 
the communication on fatigue mostly using cues to 
express their worries instead of communicating their 
concerns directly [40]. As a result, healthcare profes -
sionals will have an important role in communicating 
about fatigue and recognizing concerns that are indi -
rectly reported by patients.
Our study was subjected to some strengths and 
weaknesses [25]. The cohort used for this study was 
one of the largest studies in real life, where prospec -
tively and stringently, disease activity as well as fatigue 
was measured after stopping one of the most success -
ful anti rheumatic therapies, i.e., TNFi, while being in 
remission. Consequently, flares with changes in fatigue 
and disease activity could be expected. Our statistical 
approach proved suitable to disentangle and illustrate 
variation between two or more variables in different 
individuals, providing a more detailed insight than 
standard cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. 
One of the limitations of our study is that flares in the 
POEET cohort where immediately followed by restart 
of TNFi, so major and long-lasting flares are rare. 
However, the data as they are with mostly mild and 
short flares clearly illustrated the overall and individ -
ual associations between the different indices of dis -
ease activity and fatigue. Major and long-lasting flares 
would likely only have strengthened this conclusion.
Our study was explorative in design as a first dem -
onstration that the relation between disease activity 
and fatigue is different in individual patients. Future 
research may focus on the possible reasons for these 
differences and on identifying groups of patients 
with the same or absent associations. Now that most 
patients with RA are able to achieve remission, fatigue 
remains one of the most debilitating symptom for 
some patients. We believe, that our data support the 
need for a more personalized approach to further 
improve the management of fatigue in RA. Optimal 
anti-inflammatory treatment may need to be com -
bined with neuro-psychological interventions based 
upon the needs of individual RA-patients. Many per -
sonal factors, which healthcare providers may not 
always know or be able to influence, will contribute to 
varying degrees to fatigue in RA patients. Differences 
in associations between disease activity and fatigue 
between different patients must be first recognized 
before knowledge and interventions in this area can 
be improved. RA patients suffering from fatigue some -
times, but not always, have high disease activity and 
therefore do not always need more or different medi -
cation. But they will all need to be approached and 
advised with respect and to the best of our knowledge.Conclusion
Our results show that in some patients inflammatory 
disease activity and fatigue are related, while in other 
patients this association seems absent. More research 
on the complex relation between disease activity and 
fatigue in RA and other inflammation driven diseases is 
necessary, but our results point to the need for a more 
individually targeted approach of fatigue in RA, both in 
research and daily clinical practice.
