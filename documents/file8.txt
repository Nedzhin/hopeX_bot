Management of Fatigue in Rheumatoid
Arthritis
Janet E Pope
ABSTRACT
Fatigue in rheumatoid arthritis is highly prevalent. It is
correlated only weakly with disease activity but more so withpain, mood, personality features, poor sleep, obesity andcomorbidities. Fatigue can be measured by many standardisedquestionnaires and more easily with a Visual Analogue Scale ornumeric rating scale. Most patients with RA have some fatigue,and at least one in six have severe fatigue. Chronic pain and
depressed mood are also common in RA patients with
significant fatigue. It affects function and quality of life and isworse on average in women. Evidence-based treatment forfatigue includes treatment of underlying disease activity (withon average modest improvement of fatigue), exerciseprogrammes and supervised self-management programmeswith cognitive-behavioural therapy, mindfulness andreinforcement (such as reminders). The specific programmesfor exercise and behavioural interventions are notstandardised. Some medications cause fatigue such asmethotrexate. More research is needed to understand fatigueand how to treat this common complex symptom in RA thatcan be the worst symptom for some patients.
SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune
inflammatory condition with joint damage,pain, functional impairment and fatigue.
1
Even though there are many treatmentsapproved for RA, fatigue affects at least three-quarters of patients.
2Using a fatigue Visual
Analogue Scale (VAS), 50% of RA patientshave fatigue, that is at least five out of 10.
23
Fatigue can be from disease activity, chronic
pain, sleep disturbance, poor mood and otherreasons including comorbidities. It is often cor-related with disease activity but more with
strongly with pain.
24When there are high
inflammatory markers, cytokines that are ele-
vated may cause a person to feel tired or evenexhausted. This can be similar to the prodrome
of an infection.
5
A previous review of fatigue in RA did not
consistently show the same factors associatedwith fatigue.
4Depressed mood, sleep distur-
bance and functional impairment (disability)
appear to frequently explain fatigue in
patients with RA. Of course, if it can beexhausting to do usual activities when RA isactive, and damage and/or pain will worsenfatigue. Many activities of daily living areaffected in RA patients such as dressing, walk-
ing, meal preparation, eating and personal
care such as bathing.
6
When fatigue is rated very high repeatedly, it
is likely not related solely to active RA. Thereare differences in the findings of associationswith physical function and significant fatigue
in RA. For instance, severe fatigue in people
with RA is associated with self-rated health,pain and anxiety/depression rather than with
physical capacity.
7Whereas, in multivariate
models, severe fatigue has been associated
with females more than males, disease activity,
impaired function, current treatment with
NSAIDs and biologics, multimorbidity, obesityand anxiety/depression. Severe fatigue has
been correlated with the number of morbid
conditions, including obesity, hypertension,COPD and anxiety/depression.
8Fatigue cer-
tainly is related to pain and mental healthissues (depressed mood) and with othercomorbidities whereby more health problems
increase the likelihood of fatigue in RA.
More than three-quarters of patients with
RA experience chronic pain within 5 yearsof their diagnosis.
9Personality traits and
stress will affect fatigue in RA. RA patients
have higher stress compared with osteoar-
thritis and population controls.10–12It was
observed that worrying, catastrophising andTo cite: Pope JE. Management

logical function,13and pain catastrophising (helpless-
ness) worsens stress even when adjusting for age,
gender and pain, all of which likely impact fatigue
adversely.14In contrast, the authors of a recent study
concluded that fatigue was associated more in extro-
verts with RA.6However, the association between fati-
gue and personality traits likely needs verification inother studies. In general, if very few studies find anassociation between patient factors and fatigue, then
more research may reconcile if findings are consistent
and generalizable to fatigue in RA.
A framework has been suggested of fatigue in RA and
includes disease factors (inflammation, pain, disruptedsleep and disability), personal factors (comorbidities andwork) and cognitive-behavioural interface (personality,
thoughts and feelings driving reactions and activity).
15 16
Figure 1 shows factors that can impact fatigue and their
relative contribution to chronic fatigue in RA. Cliniciansshould note that disease activity only plays a minor role in
chronic severe patient-reported fatigue. Consideration ofpain, mood and poor sleep could be explored in each
patient in order to determine a more comprehensive treat-
ment plan. Patient comorbidities that could contribute topoor sleep such as sleep apnea should be ruled out when
there is a high index of suspicion. Anaemia, hypothyroid-
ism, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and other morbiditiescan contribute to fatigue.
Measurement of fatigue in RA
Numerous fatigue tools/scales have been used in RA.
A systematic review described 23 different fatigue tools
which were published before Patient-Reported OutcomesMeasurement Information System (PROMIS) was
developed.
17 18In their review, they concluded that ordi-
nal (Likert) and VAS, the Short Form 36 vitality subscale,
the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy
Fatigue Scale (FACIT), the RA-specific Multidimensional
Assessment of Fatigue scale (MAF) and the Profile ofMood States were validated and seemed sensitive to
change.
17 19 20Some scales are generic, and others are
disease specific.
Commonly used measures of fatigue in RA include
numeric rating scales such as VAS 0 to 100 mm or an 11-
point scale (from 0 to 10). Other scales such as change infatigue have been used (such as 5-point scale from much
worse, worse, no change, better and much better). Other
questionnaires within RA trials include the FunctionalAssessment of Chronic Illness-Fatigue (FACIT-F); Bristol
Rheumatoid Arthritis Fatigue-Multidimensional Ques-
tionnaire (BRAF-MDQ); SF-36 vitality domain (0 to 100)and PROMIS-29 Fatigue T-score. The FACIT-F scale
ranges from 0 to 52, where higher numbers imply less
fatigue. Fatigue scales are correlated to each other, butthere is no universally agreed-upon fatigue question-
naire/tool to use in RA.
17–20The PROMIS fatigue score
has face validity; measures fatigue across the spectrum of
severity; is correlated with pain, sleep disturbance, anxiety
and depression and disease activity and is also strongly
correlated with other fatigue scales.18
Concordance with active diseaseRA disease activity and fatigue are correlated in many
studies, but often the associations are weak.
42 1 –23When
patients with RA flare, usually pain and fatigue increase.24
For instance, fatigue was associated with flare in RApatients with the TNF inhibitor dose decreased, but

baseline DAS28 and mental health.25
The mean fatigue in RA patients studied cross-sectionally
was 4/10, with 40% having severe fatigue.9Associations
with fatigue are not necessarily consistent between studies.
High fatigue in one study was associated with females,disease activity, function, treatment and multimorbidity
(especially obesity and anxiety/depression). However, sig-
nificant fatigue in RA in another study was associated withself-rated poor health, pain and anxiety/depression but
not physical capacity/function.
7
In the Canadian early RA (ERA) cohort (CATCH
cohort), correlations between fatigue and disease activitywere studied. It was found that fatigue was related to pain
and the patient global rating moderately at baseline butonly weakly correlated with disease activity as measured by
swollen and tender joint counts, physician global assess-
ment of disease activity and inflammatory markers.
26Fati-
gue at baseline and at 3 months predicted fatigue, pain,
joint counts, global assessments and disease activity at
12 months.26In general, fatigue is weakly correlated
with disease activity.27In general, medications that
improve disease activity partially improve fatigue.28
Another study suggested that the variation in fatigue wasexplained by problems other than RA including obesity,
physical inactivity, poor sleep and depression.
16Worse
Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) was related to
higher fatigue, especially in women with RA, even when
treating to a target.29Poor function and fatigue could be
the results of other factors such as depression and pain as
many of these variables are inter-related. The biggest
predictor of fatigue at 1 year in ERA was baseline fatigue
and fatigue at 3 months.30In summary, disease activity
and other patient-reported outcomes in RA are often
concordant with fatigue, but RA disease activity does not
account for most of the fatigue in RA.
Discordance with disease activity
Fatigue in RA is usually present even if disease activity is
low. This can be due to chronic pain which is common in
RA. Pain can lead to poor sleep, depressed mood andfatigue, all of which are connected.
61 82 83 13 2Also, more
than 10% of patients with RA have fibromyalgia33and
10% report depression in ERA.26Behavioural and psy-
chological factors are more likely explanations of fatigue
in RA and not disease activity.16
When patients with ERA were treated using a treat-to-
target strategy, it was observed that there was only a smallmean change in fatigue. In fact, three-quarters with base-
line fatigue who had improved with respect to diseaseactivity had residual fatigue at 1 year
30; in another study
one in four ERA patients had worsening fatigue over time,one in three was stable and 40% improved fatigue by
1 year.
34
Remission does not necessarily equate to low fatigue
When in remission in ERA, many patients have low levelsof fatigue; but some still have significant fatigue. RApatients with a sustained state of low disease activity
(LDA) had a mean FACIT-F score in the 40s so residual
fatigue persisted for many patients.
35The SF-36 vitality
domain (scale, 0 –100) demonstrated all but approxi-
mately 15% were not in fatigue remission when in DASremission (DAS of <2.6).
36
Within the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology
(OMERACT) flare working group, a Delphi exercise wasperformed, and fatigue did not meet consensus for inclu-sion within the development of the flare questionnaire in
RA.
24Fatigue in RA is multifactorial and only partially
related to disease activity which may have accounted for
poor agreement with respect to a fatigue domain within a
flare questionnaire in RA.
Reasons for fatigue in RA
There are several causes of fatigue in RA.2–51 01 6For
instance, active RA with inflammation22and pain cause
fatigue directly by altered cytokines but also disruption ofsleep due to pain.
451 0Chronic pain alters sleep through
changes in mood affecting sleep patterns.25691 6
Decreases in physical activity and stress due to a chronicdisease that is life altering will impact energy in a negativeway.
7Medications such as methotrexate and even sulfasa-
lazine can cause fatigue.73 7Different routes of adminis-
tration or dosing of methotrexate may be helpful toreduce fatigue as a side effect.
37Treatments should be
multidimensional in order to improve fatigue in peopleliving with RA.
Chronic pain and fibromyalgia in RA influence fatigue
In ERA, fibromyalgia is increased 10-fold in the first yearand fivefold in the second year after the onset of RA.
Fibromyalgia was related to pain and poor mental health
and not inflammation.
33
Timing of maximal improvement in fatigue when in sustainedremission in ERA
An ERA cohort which included 1864 patients studied how
fatigue varied over time.
26A quarter had low fatigue,
nearly 20% moderate and approximately 60% high fati-
gue at baseline. The baseline fatigue and pain scores were
similar, around 5 out of 10. DAS28 seemed to be moder-ately related to fatigue at baseline where the DAS28 score
was highest in the highest fatigue level, next highest in the
middle level and smallest in the lowest fatigue group.
The baseline SF-36 mental component summary scores
(MCS of SF-36) also were different differed significantlybetween the fatigue groups. The mean baseline fatiguescore measured by a VAS was highest at baseline than
follow-up visits. Fatigue decreased by the 3-months visit
where the largest between visit change occurred (frombaseline to 3 months compared to other time points
within the first year).
If a patient achieved remission or a low disease state by
3 months, this was predictive of lower fatigue over timethan if they did not. The question was asked when the
lowest fatigue level occurred after a patient with ERA wasRheumatoid arthritis
Pope JE. RMD Open 2020; 6:e001084. doi:10.1136/rmdopen-2019-001084 3 on November 6, 2023 by guest. Protected by copyright. http://rmdopen.bmj.com/ RMD Open: first published as 10.1136/rmdopen-2019-001084 on 7 May 2020. Downloaded from in sustained remission. The lowest mean level of fatigue
seemed to lag behind remission by many months. This
could imply that once disease activity has markedlyimproved, it takes time to optimise fatigue. One could
speculate that it takes time after chronic inflammation is
controlled to have better quality and quantity of sleep.Sustained remission within 1 year of ERA onset was asso-
ciated with improved fatigue compared with not achiev-
ing remission with parallel decrements, except optimallowest fatigue level lagged behind remission by approxi-
mately half a year.
26
Established RA: is there a lag in fatigue improvement?
Patients with RA in the Ontario Best Practices ResearchInitiative (OBRI) registry that were not in a low disease
state at baseline were followed to determine if patient-
reported outcomes (PROs) improved differently compar-ing ERA with established RA. In nearly 1000 RA patients
of whom one-third had early disease, time to remission
was faster in ERA as was time to achieving a physician andpatient global assessment of 0 or 1 out of 10. However, the
time to improving fatigue was the same in both those with
early and established RA.
38
TREATMENTThere is no uniform treatment for fatigue in RA, and
many proven interventions have small effect sizes from
small trials. This is probably due to the fact that fatigue isfrom multiple different causes within and between indi-
viduals and that when it becomes chronic, it is less likely to
dramatically improve. This seems similar to chronic painin RA. Treatment can be divided into pharmacologic and
non-pharmacologic. Table 1 illustrates the evidence of
treatment of fatigue in RA. Future research should be
focused on designing well-powered randomised trials of
interventions thought to have at least a moderate effect
size. Possibly several interventions could be studied in onetrial in order to determine if there is incremental benefit
combining multiple modalities and thereby increasing
the likelihood of a larger treatment effect. For instance,a trial could be designed comparing exercise, cognitive-
behavioural therapy (CBT) and pharmacological treat-
ment together versus each individual treatment. Betterinterventions for fatigue in RA are an unmet need.
Pharmacologic treatment of fatigue
Pharmacological treatment of fatigue in RA has beenprimarily studied by treating disease activity and/orpain. Treating to a target and achieving rapid remissionor very low disease state in ERA predicts lower fatigue
early and later (even at 5 years).
26Effective treatment in
RA will only partially reduce fatigue if it is related to the
disease activity in RA.
Virtually all treatments in RA will reduce fatigue,
including conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-
rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), targeted synthetic
DMARDs, biologic DMARDs and corticosteroids.37 39 –54The average effect of treatment on fatigue in active RAwith various advanced therapies is meaningful but not
large.
39Treatment of disease activity in RA has a small
impact on fatigue, whereas physical inactivity, poor sleep
and depressed mood explain most of the fatigue.28Often
fatigue is an exploratory outcome in trials. Medications
can cause or exacerbate fatigue. A strong predictor of
nonadherence to methotrexate was fatigue (but baseline
fatigue was not related to methotrexate; whereas increas-
ing fatigue later could be due to methotrexate).37
More than 2000 patients with RA who were followed in
a registry and started either methotrexate monotherapy
or a TNFi were studied to determine associations with
fatigue.40At 6 months, nearly one-third were in remission
with a median fatigue of 2/10 and 25th percentile was 0.6
and 75th percentile was 4.3/10. However, 28% had fati-
gue >4/10. Higher pain levels at baseline and 6 months
were associated with fatigue. So, other methods of treat-ing fatigue in RA are needed beyond treatment of active
disease. In a different study, 48 RA patients demonstrated
significant improvements in fatigue measured by the Fati-gue Severity Scale after initiation of biologic DMARDs.
41
PROs such as fatigue, pain and patient global assessmenthave only weak correlations in active RA when biologicsare used.
42
Improvement in fatigue has been related to the line of
therapy in a review of abatacept trials. Abataceptimproved fatigue more than placebo, and improvements
in fatigue were higher in ERA compared with biologic
exposed patients.
43More than 1500 patients from the
three trials were analysed, and the authors concluded
that improvement in fatigue and other outcomes such
as pain, sleep and remission had poor agreement andearlier lines of therapy had more responsiveness with
respect to fatigue in patients treatd with abatacept.
Half the patients in the Corrona Database reated with
rituximab (N=667) after one or more TNF inhibitors hadimprovement in fatigue.
44
Interleukin-6 may be important in the perception of
fatigue, as it is an inflammatory cytokine. There are two
anti-IL-6 biological treatments approved for RA. Tocili-
zumab improves signs and symptoms of active RA in
RCTs including fatigue.45In an observational study, at
2 years of follow-up, tocilizum ab significantly decreased
fatigue.46The variance in fatigue in a tocilizumab treat-
ment study was explained mostly by sleepiness, depres-sive symptoms and disease activity (DAS28).
47In RCTs,
sarilumab has shown improvement in PROs, with aneffect size that was clinically relevant for fatigue but notas large as for pain.
48
The Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have also demon-
strated clinically relevant improvements in fatigue inpatients with active RA across lines of therapy such as
in ERA (methotrexate naive), methotrexate inade-
quate responders and biologic inadequateresponders.
49–54Tofacitinib and baricitinib are
approved in many countries and upadacitinib hasbeen approved in the USA and elsewhere. It isRMD Open

Treatment with baricitinib in active RA patients whowere inadequate responders to methotrexate improved
pain, fatigue, function and work productivity more
than placebo.
52Possibly, JAK inhibitors are more effec-
tive in treating pain in active RA than TNF inhibitors
(or at least adalimumab), and this may also corre-
spond to improved fatigue.49 51Not all RA treatment
trials show superiority with respect to fatigue as an
outcome and some individuals will respond better to
one treatment than another, so there are no strongpredictors with respect to who will have a marked
improvement in fatigue when treating active RA.
Non-pharmacologic treatment of fatigue in RA
The age of the patient with RA does not seem to affect thechoice of non-pharmacologic treatment for improving
fatigue in RA, so similar strategies for treating fatigue
may be applicable to all adults with RA.
55Physical activity and psychological interventions are
effective in reducing fatigue in RA.56A Cochrane meta-
analysis of RCT of nonpharmacological interventions in
RA patients with fatigue analysed six trials, with 388
patients showing physical activity improved fatigue bya difference of 14 points on a 0 to 100 fatigue scale
compared with controls.
56The number needed to treat
to have a beneficial effect was 7.56Another systematic
review compared trials using the minimal important dif-ference and it also showed that aerobic exercise was effec-
tive in reducing fatigue, but most participants would notachieve a clinically relevant improvement in fatigue.
57It
was shown that providing pedometers with or withoutproviding step targets was helpful in increasing physicalactivity in RA with a small reduction in fatigue.
58The
effect size of most physical activity interventions for fati-gue improvement in RA is small.
Older patients with RA (>65 years) were compared with
respect to changes in fatigue between a 20-weekTable 1 Summary of treatment of fatigue in RA

Pope JE. RMD Open 2020; 6:e001084. doi:10.1136/rmdopen-2019-001084 5 on November 6, 2023 by guest. Protected by copyright. http://rmdopen.bmj.com/ RMD Open: first published as 10.1136/rmdopen-2019-001084 on 7 May 2020. Downloaded from moderate-intensity to high-intensity exercise at a gym
with supervision, or exercise of light intensity at home.
Exercise did not improve fatigue rated by a VAS. How-ever, using the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-
20), both physical and mental fatigue improved more in
the moderate-intensity to high-intensity group at thegym.
59We do not know if the improvements would be
sustained after the programme ended nor if it was thesocialisation/attention that improved fatigue versus theactual exercise.
In RA, it is uncertain what exercise to recommend to
patients with high fatigue and whether supervision has‘added-value ’. Patients with RA who were in an exercise
trial felt that physical activity was important for copingwith fatigue.
60Time with a physiotherapist guiding
a personalised exercise programme was also important.
Of course, patients who agreed to be interviewed had
already participated in a trial, so the sample could bebiased in favour of exercise.
In one study, a comprehensive exercise programme to
improve fatigue in RA consisted of seven sessions witha physiotherapist who provided handouts, discussed the
benefits of exercise (in general and disease specific),
demonstrated exercises and equipment and allowedpatients to choose exercises with supervision. Patients
completed an activity diary, set goals and had graded
exercises. They re-evaluated their goals over the pro-gramme and learnt pacing, stress reduction and relaxa-
tion techniques and weight reduction.
61Interestingly,
motivational counselling followed by text message remin-
ders to improve physical activity improved pain. There
was sustained increased exercising 18 months after the
intervention.62Fatigue reduced by 12 mm on a 100 mm
VAS which was a small difference but clinically relevant.
RCTs of weight loss in RA are sparse. Obesity is com-
mon and is a risk factor for RA. In ERA, one-third ofpatients are at ideal weight, one-third are overweight
and one-third are obese.
63Studies in psoriatic arthritis
have demonstrated that weight reduction improves dis-
ease activity.64Dietary manipulation to provide improve-
ment in pain in RA and weight reduction has beenstudied, but studies are small with a high risk of bias anddo not provide definitive data on improving disease activ-
ity or fatigue.
65
Thirteen trials of psychosocial interventions in RA stu-
died a total of 1579 patients. The mean difference infatigue between the treatment and control groups was
10 (on a 0 to 100 scale) with an NNT of 10. The overallquality of the trials was low; and the effect size was modest
at best.
56A very large RCT was published using
a cognitive-behavioural approach to decrease fatigue in
RA over 2 years (Reducing Arthritis Fatigue Trial).66Fati-
gue had to be at least six out of 10 to be enrolled in thetrial. For the group randomised to cognitive-behaviouralapproach, seven sessions were given by trained rheuma-
tology occupational therapists and nurses. Whereas the
control group received a usual care booklet. There were333 randomised, of whom 93% completed outcomes at26 weeks. A small improvement in the active (cognitive-
behavioural) treatment group that persisted to 2 years was
observed, including the impact of fatigue and self-efficacy. Satisfaction with the intervention was higher in
active treatment (89%) vs controls (54%). The minimal
clinically important difference in RA for change withina fatigue scale is likely to be at least 10%. The control
group changed by 12% and the cognitive-behavioural
group by 19%, so the between-group difference was verysmall. The rating of fatigue, unfortunately, was not differ-
ent between the groups, but coping with fatigue was
better in the intervention group.
Other studies in the Cochrane review were either nega-
tive or not analyzable for fatigue, including one trial eachof herbal treatment, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,a Mediterranean diet, reflexology and the use of Health
Tracker information (one large trial with 714
participants).
56
Theoretically, improving sleep quality can help fatigue.
Patients with RA who have a lower quality of sleep havemore fatigue.
67
Maintaining ability to workPatients with RA who maintained their ability to workhad less fatigue compared to those who were work dis-
abled, and these differences seemed related to better
mental health, not physical health.
68However, other
factors are likely related to an ability to work, which
may not have been measured, where both fatigue and
work disability are a consequence of joint damage, age,type of job, less flexibility at work and so on.
A prospective study is needed to determine if
a programme that keeps people in the workplace willimprove fatigue.
Behavioural interventions
A 12-month-long self-management programme delivered
via the internet did not improve pain or fatigue comparedwith standard of care treatment in an RCT of 157 patients
with RA.
69
Vitamins and supplementsIn RA patients who are vitamin D deficient, there does not
appear to be clinically relevant improvements in RA withvitamin D supplementation, even though function and
inflammatory markers slightly improved.
70A systematic
review showed that vitamin D had no improvement in
fatigue.56This is contrary to systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE), where data suggest that vitamin D supplementationmay improve fatigue.
71
Omega 3 supplementation or fish oil has some positive
RCTs in active RA improving disease activity when addedto standard of care.
72 73However, the effects on fatigue
are uncertain.
It seems that social support, hope, optimism and resi-
lience improve fatigue.74Perhaps ways at improving resi-
lience and social support can also help people with RA
who have significant fatigue. There are no RCTs.RMD Open

Tight control alone does not fully improve fatigue. At
12 months, 43% of RA patients experienced ongoingfatigue in a treat to target strategy study. Nearly one in
four who were fatigued at the onset of the study showed
lower levels of fatigue by 1 year, but one in six of thepatients who were not initially fatigued recorded
increased fatigue.
30
Treatment of anaemia should theoretically improve
fatigue. RA can cause anaemia of chronic disease.A Cochrane review of erythropoietin for anaemia in RA
did improve patient global assessment, but the results forfatigue were not provided or inconsistent.
75
An RCT of morphine and naloxone studied pain in
various conditions including RA. Active treatment wascomparable with placebo.
76An RCT of tetrahydrocanna-
binol (THC) for treating chronic pain in RA and ankylos-ing spondylitis is ongoing, and outcomes will include painand fatigue.
77The design is innovative as cannabidiol
(CBD) nonresponders will have THC added to theirtreatment after 12 weeks.
SUMMARY
In conclusion, fatigue in RA is due to multiple factors and
only partially from disease activity. The treatment ofactive RA can improve fatigue somewhat. Many predictors
such as high pain, multimorbidity, obesity, personality
factors and depressed mood increase the likelihood offatigue. Other reviews have provided insights into the
effects of pain and psychological factors on fatigue in
RA.

Treatment of fatigue is difficult with some positive data
for exercise, CBT and some self-management pro-grammes with reminders. In general, treatment effectsin RCTs of fatigue in RA are small. It is unknown if weight
loss can improve fatigue, but dietary changes have not
resulted in positive results. There are multiple naturalherbals and other vitamins and minerals that claim to
help fatigue in chronic disease (and have multimillion
dollars of sales), but lack RCT ‘proof ’. More research is
needed to find an effective treatment of fatigue after
disease activity is controlled. Until then, fatigue will have
a negative impact on many people living with RA.
