Abstract: Introduction: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune illness that manifests
mostly as chronic, symmetric, and progressive polyarthritis with a global frequency of 0.3–1.0%. RA
is a disease that affects people all over the world. In India, the prevalence is estimated to be 0.7%,
with around 10 million persons suffering from RA. Most people with rheumatoid arthritis experience
fatigue on most days, with over 70% experiencing symptoms similar to chronic fatigue syndrome.
Patients rate fatigue as a top priority and believe this unmanageable symptom is ignored by clinicians;
a systematic review shows the biological agents for RA inﬂammation have only a small effect on
fatigue. Fatigue predicts and reduces the quality of life, and it is as difﬁcult to cope with as pain.
Physicians have traditionally concentrated on the inﬂammatory aspects of the illness (e.g., synovitis),
whereas RA patients have prioritized pain, exhaustion, sleep difﬁculties, and other quality-of-life
issues. Aims and Objectives: The basic aim of the study was to access the incidence of fatigue in
rheumatoid arthritis and evaluate its impact on the quality of life in these patients using the MAF
scale (multidimensional assessment of fatigue) after prior permission for the ﬁrst time in an Asian
population. Results: A total of 140 subjects and 100 controls were included in the study. Age was
closely matched between the study subjects and controls. Among study subjects with the disease,
94 (67%) had a disease duration 5 years, 26 (19%) had a disease duration between 6–10 years,
10 (7%) had a duration of 11–15 years and 10 (7%) had >10 years disease duration. Among the sample,
31 (25%) study subjects had a DAS score 4.0, 63 (50%) study subjects had a DAS score (disease
activity score) between 4.01 and 6.0, and in the remaining 31 (25%) study subjects, the DAS score
was >6.0. The mean DAS score among study subjects was 4.96, and the study subjects had a mean
activity of daily living (ADL) score of 11.64; controls had a mean score of 2.42 with a statistically
signiﬁcant p-value. The global fatigue index was higher in study subjects, with a mean of 33.16 in
contrast with a mean of 14.41 in the controls with a signiﬁcant p-value. Conclusion: Our study
fatigue was a persistent problem, despite treatment. The median level of fatigue experienced by
study subjects with RA was high. Therefore, as persistent fatigue is associated with functional loss,
fatigue in RA remains an ‘unmet need’ and continues to be ignored by clinicians.

1. Introduction
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune illness that manifests mostly as
chronic, symmetric, and progressive polyarthritis, with a global frequency of 0.3–1.0% [1].
Women are up to ﬁve times more likely to get RA than males, and those over the age of
40 have the highest prevalence rates [ 2]. People from all around the world are afﬂicted by
RA. In women over the age of 70, the overall prevalence of RA increases to 5%. Around
10 million people in India are thought to have RA, making the prevalence there 0.7% [ 3].
Clin. Pract. 2022 ,12, 591–598. https://doi.org/10.3390/clinpract12040062 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/clinpractClin. Pract. 2022 ,12 592
Over 70% of persons with rheumatoid arthritis report having symptoms like chronic fatigue
syndrome on most days [4,5].
Fatigue is typically characterized as a state of exhaustion and weakness accompanied
by a sense of weariness, drowsiness, and irritability, as well as a cognitive component [ 6].
Physiological exhaustion that occurs after strenuous physical exertion provides a signal to
the body to rest so that the depleted tissues (that is, the muscles) can be rescued. Patho-
logical fatigue, unlike normal exhaustion, does not improve with rest. Most acute and
chronic inﬂammatory disorders, including arthritis, cause this type of fatigue. Fatigue is
considered an extra-articular symptom, and it is the most prevalent complaint among RA
patients, outnumbering pain by 42 to more than 80% [ 7]. Social variables, gender, cognition
and emotion, sleep disturbances, pain, and environmental factors may all play a role in
fatigue onset [ 8]. Because fatigue is a symptom of subjective experience, the most frequent
descriptive method is self-assessment.
Fatigue is deﬁnitely a sign of rheumatic diseases. According to OMERACT [ 9], fatigue
is an essential outcome to examine in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and it has been linked to
the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28), the ESR, and the Clinical Disease Activity Index [ 10].
Patients describe fatigue as a major source of anxiety, on par with pain, as overpowering,
uncontrolled, and unaddressed by physicians. Signiﬁcant fatigue affects up to 70% of RA
patients, affects the quality of life, and is just as difﬁcult to manage as pain. Because fatigue
has been identiﬁed as an unmet need among RA patients, an international agreement has
emerged that fatigue must now be assessed in all RA clinical studies. [ 11]. Fatigue has
a wide range of effects on patients’ lives and is a signiﬁcant result for many, although it
is presently not one of the seven universally agreed-upon key outcome measures in RA
clinical studies [ 12,13]. Fatigue is cited by people with RA as the primary cause of job
loss, affecting more than 60% of working patients and resulting in a production loss of
more than GBP 650 million [ 14]. Patients rate fatigue as a top priority and believe that
this unmanageable symptom is ignored by clinicians [ 12]; a systematic review shows that
biological agents for RA inﬂammation have only a small effect on fatigue [ 15]. Fatigue
predicts activities of daily living (ADLs) and reduces the quality of life, and it is as difﬁcult
to cope with as pain. Physicians have traditionally concentrated on the inﬂammatory
aspects of the illness (e.g., synovitis), whereas RA patients have prioritized pain, fatigue,
sleep difﬁculties, and other quality-of-life issues [ 16]. Fatigue in rheumatoid arthritis is now
the most evolving topic in rheumatology, and our study is the ﬁrst of its kind in the Asian
subcontinent; it will be a stepping stone in the evaluation of the geographical variability of
fatigue in rheumatoid arthritis.
2. Aims and Objectives
The basic aim of the study was to access the incidence of fatigue in rheumatoid
arthritis and evaluate its impacts on the quality of life in these patients using the MAF scale
(multidimensional assessment of fatigue), being used after prior permission for the ﬁrst
time in Asian population.
3. Material and Methods: [Study Design]
Our present study, entitled “Assessment of Fatigue in Rheumatoid Arthritis and its
Impact on Quality of Life”, is an observational, case–control one-point study that was
conducted from November 2017 to October 2018. The protocol was reviewed and approved
by the GMC Jammu ethical committee under order no. PGRP/2017/MDGMC. The study
subjects were included after giving written informed consent and after receiving a full
explanation of the nature and purpose of the study before participating in the study.
4. Participant Inclusion Criteria
Study subjects diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis according to the 2010-ACR-
EULAR classiﬁcation criteria for rheumatoid arthritis aged 16 years and above were
included in the study as cases and compared with age- and sex-matched controls attend-Clin. Pract. 2022 ,12 593
ing medicine/ rheumatology OPD having health conditions other than musculoskeletal
complains in GMC Jammu.
5. Exclusion Criteria
Patients who need hospital admission, critically ill patients, pregnant or lactating
women, a diagnosis other than RA like osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic
sclerosis, chronic kidney disease, or diabetes mellitus.
6. Data Collection
The demographic proﬁles of all the study subjects were noted, and subjects were
enrolled after giving written informed consent. A detailed history of RA and any other
coexistence disease was obtained. A detailed physical examination of the study subjects
was also performed.
Patients were on treatment for rheumatoid arthritis with DMARDS mainly, and disease
activity was measured with the DAS 28, the ESR, and online calculators using the variables
tender joint count, swollen joint count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The degree
of fatigue was assessed with the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue (MAF) [ 17,18]
scale in both study subjects and controls. The MAF is a 16-item scale that measures fatigue
according to four dimensions: degree and severity, distress that it causes, the timing
of fatigue (over the past week, when it occurred, and any changes), and its impact on
various activities of daily living (household chores, cooking, bathing, dressing, working,
socializing, sexual activity, leisure and recreation, shopping, walking, and exercising). The
global fatigue index (GFI) is a measure that quantiﬁes ﬁve dimensions of fatigue from the
Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue instrument into one score and a newly scored
item 15; Item 16 of MAF is not included in the GFI. A higher score indicates more severe
fatigue, fatigue distress, or impact on activities of daily living.
The activity of daily living (ADL) score was used to look for the quantum of disability
in RA patients. The ADL score consists of 12 items related to daily activities. It tests whether
the patient can perform daily activities independently or whether they are unable to do so.
The quality of life of the subjects was assessed with the World Health Organization
Quality of Life BREF (WHOQOL-BREF). The WHOQOL-BREF produces a quality-of-life
proﬁle with four domain scores (physical, psychological, social, and environmental). The
four domain scores denote an individual’s perception of quality of life in each particular
domain. The domain scores are scaled in a positive direction, i.e, higher scores denote a
higher quality of life. The mean score of items within each domain was used to calculate
the domain score. The raw scores were then transformed to a 0–100 scale. The MAF scale
was used to assess fatigue in RA patients. It includes questions about fatigue and the effects
of fatigue on daily activities [17,18].
7. Statistical Analysis
All the data obtained from the subjects of the study group were noted in a Pro-forma
especially designed for this purpose. The data were analyzed using appropriate statistical
techniques in Open Stat software. After extraction, the data were revised, coded, and fed
to statistical software IBM SPSS version 22 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All statistical
analyses were conducted using two-tailed tests. A p-value less than 0.05 was statistically
signiﬁcant. Comparative analysis between study cohorts was conducted for all variables
including patients’ biodemographic data, quality of life, DAS28, ESR score, ADL, and
MAF was used based on cross-tabulation. The signiﬁcance of the relationships in cross-
tabulation was tested using the Pearson chi-square test for categorical parameters, while
scale variables were compared using the independent samples t-test.
8. Results
A total of 140 study subjects and 100 controls were taken into the study with ages
closely matched with controls. The study subjects had a mean age of 47 years comparedClin. Pract. 2022 ,12 594
with the control mean of 42 years with a p-value of 0.073. The distribution of patients
according to age is shown in Table 1 below.

Among study subjects with the disease, 94 (67%) had a disease duration 5 years,
26 (19%) had a disease duration between 6 and 10 years, 10 (7%) had a duration of
11–15 years , and 10 (7%) had >10 years disease duration. In the group, 31 (25%) patients
had a DAS score 4.0, 63 (50%) patients had a DAS score between 4.01 and 6.0, and in the
remaining 31 (25%) subjects, the DAS score was > 6.0. The mean DAS score among study
subjects was 4.96.
The study subjects had a mean ADL score of 11.64, while the controls had a mean
score of 2.42 with a statistically signiﬁcant p-value as shown in Table 3.
The global fatigue index (GFI) was higher in the study subjects, with a mean of 33.16,
whereas in controls, it was 14.41 with a signiﬁcant p-value.
The global fatigue index showed a signiﬁcant impact of disease on fatigue parameters
when compared with controls as p-value showed a very signiﬁcant difference as shown in

All four parameters that deﬁne the quality of life showed statistically signiﬁcant
results; hence, disease has a clear effect on the quality of life of the study group along with
fatigue. Table 5 gives the detailed QOL scores of the two groups.

9. Discussion
RA is a potentially devastating condition for patients, especially in the early stages of
the disease, producing persistent pain, depression or other psychological distress, impaired
physical function, decreased quality of life (QOL), and higher medical and social costs [ 19].
Severe fatigue is frequent in people with RA, and it has a big inﬂuence on their quality of life
(QOL). Physicians often overlook RA fatigue, and anti-RA medicines have minimal effect on
fatigue [ 20]. The average ages of the patients and controls in our investigation were nearly
identical: The average age of the study subjects was 47 years, whereas the average age ofClin. Pract. 2022 ,12 596
the controls was roughly 42 years. Only 16% of subjects were male, while 84% were female,
resulting in a roughly 1:5 ratio. Although it is generally known that rheumatoid arthritis is
mostly a female illness, our ﬁndings are consistent with those of Dr. Mir Nadeem et al. [ 21]
in terms of age and gender distribution, with a female preponderance of 83% and the
majority of patients in the 30–60 age group. Our ﬁndings indicate that RA affects three
domains of QOL (physical ( p< 0.0001), psychological ( p< 0.0001 ), and environmental
(p< 0.0001 ) but not social ( p= 0.54) compared with controls, with the physical domain the
most affected. Study subjects with RA have signiﬁcantly poorer QOL than the general
population, as reported by Bendtsen et al. [22] and Suurmeijer et al. [23].
The MAF scale was utilized to measure fatigue in our study. The MAF is a RA-speciﬁc
update of the Piper Fatigue Scale [ 17]. It was designed in oncology, has demonstrated
face and content validity, and was compared with another fatigue scale and found to be
a valid and dynamic scale for RA fatigue evaluation. In our study, study subjects had a
higher global fatigue index of 33.16, compared with 14.41 in the controls, with a signiﬁcant
p-value of 0.0001. The global fatigue index (GFI) exhibited a substantial negative inﬂuence
on the physical, psychological, and environmental quality of life categories, but it had no
effect on social interactions. The mean GFI was substantially higher than that of the general
population in research by Schwarzer et al. [ 24], suggesting that fatigue is a severe issue in
RA. Furthermore, our ﬁndings matched those of earlier RA patient studies conducted in
the Netherlands and Denmark (Loppenthin et al. [ 25], Rupp et al. [ 26]). However, social
support was high in our study; this discrepancy can be explained by cultural variations,
shorter disease duration, fewer abnormalities, and lower social stigma as was seen with
parameters of the social domain for WHO-QOL. However, other researchers have indicated
that patients with RA always lack appropriate social support (Mcinnes et al.) [ 27], which is
likely due to the fact that RA is incurable and has a protracted course, resulting in deformity
and physical handicap in its later stages. Furthermore, most RA patients participate in
limited social activities, which contributes to a lack of societal support [ 28]. As a result,
social support may be very important for RA-related fatigue, and it may be able to alleviate
it to a great amount. Hence, we recommend that all patients presenting to physicians be
evaluated for fatigue; ignoring fatigue in RA patients might result in increased morbidity
in the form of poor QOL.
10. Limitations
The lack of an internationally established deﬁnition of RA fatigue, which is outside
the scope of this study, is one of the study’s shortcomings. Although our study was one of
the ﬁrst on the Asian subcontinent, it was conducted in north India, and it remains to be
seen if the ﬁndings can be applied to other people with diverse cultural backgrounds.
The MAF scale is an RA-speciﬁc update of the Piper Fatigue Scale that was designed in
oncology, has provided face and content validity, and was compared with another fatigue
scale and found to be a valid and dynamic scale for RA fatigue. However, the scale might
beneﬁt from more study, particularly in terms of content validity for RA patients, with the
inclusion of cognitive components and with validating the changes in the sensitivity of the
measurement of fatigue in these patients.
11. Conclusions
To conclude, in our study, fatigue was a persistent problem, despite treatment. The
median level of fatigue experienced by patients with RA was high. Therefore, as persistent
fatigue is associated with functional loss, fatigue in RA remains an ‘unmet need’ and
continues to be ignored by clinicians. Our study provides reasonable evidence that fatigue
can be used both as a main measure in RA and as a good predictor of physical activity and
overall quality of life.Clin. Pract. 2022 ,12 597
