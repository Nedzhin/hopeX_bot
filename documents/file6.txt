Background
Fatigue is a common and potentially distressing symptom for people with rheumatoid arthritis with no accepted evidence based
management guidelines. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical activity and psychosocial interventions, have been shown
to help people with a range of other long-term conditions to manage subjective fatigue.
Objectives
To evaluate the benefit and harm of non-pharmacological interventions for the management of fatigue in people with rheumatoid arthritis.
This included any intervention that was not classified as pharmacological in accordance with European Union (EU) Directive 2001/83/EEC.
Search methods
The following electronic databases were searched up to October 2012, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE;
EMBASE; AMED; CINAHL; PsycINFO; Social Science Citation Index; Web of Science; Dissertation Abstracts International; Current Controlled
Trials Register; The National Research Register Archive; The UKCRN Portfolio Database. In addition, reference lists of articles identified for
inclusion were checked for additional studies and key authors were contacted.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials were included if they evaluated a non-pharmacological intervention in people with rheumatoid arthritis with
self-reported fatigue as an outcome measure.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors selected relevant trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Where appropriate, data were pooled using meta-
analysis with a random-eﬀects model.
Main results
Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 2882 participants with rheumatoid arthritis. Included studies investigated
physical activity interventions (n = 6 studies; 388 participants), psychosocial interventions (n = 13 studies; 1579 participants), herbal
medicine (n = 1 study; 58 participants), omega-3 fatty acid supplementation (n = 1 study; 81 participants), Mediterranean diet (n = 1 study;
51 participants), reflexology (n = 1 study; 11 participants) and the provision of Health Tracker information (n = 1 study; 714 participants).

Physical activity was statistically significantly more eﬀective than the control at the end of the intervention period (standardized mean
diﬀerence (SMD) -0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.62 to -0.10; back translated to mean diﬀerence of 14.4 points lower, 95% CI -4.0 to
-24.8 on a 100 point scale where a lower score means less fatigue; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB)
7, 95% CI 4 to 26) demonstrating a small beneficial eﬀect upon fatigue. Psychosocial intervention was statistically significantly more
eﬀective than the control at the end of the intervention period (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.07; back translated to mean diﬀerence of
9.6 points lower, 95% CI -2.8 to -16.0 on a 100 point scale, lower score means less fatigue; NNTB 10, 95% CI 6 to 33) demonstrating a
small beneficial eﬀect upon fatigue. For the remaining interventions meta-analysis was not possible and there was either no statistically
significant diﬀerence between trial arms or findings were not reported. Only three studies reported any adverse events and none of these
were serious, however, it is possible that the low incidence was in part due to poor reporting. The quality of the evidence ranged from
moderate quality for physical activity interventions and Mediterranean diet to low quality for psychosocial interventions and all other
interventions.
Authors' conclusions
This review provides some evidence that physical activity and psychosocial interventions provide benefit in relation to self-reported fatigue
in adults with rheumatoid arthritis. There is currently insuﬀicient evidence of the eﬀectiveness of other non-pharmacological interventions.

Non-pharmacological interventions for the management of patient-reported fatigue in rheumatoid arthritis
This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research that has investigated the eﬀects of non-pharmacological
treatments for fatigue in people with rheumatoid arthritis.
A/f_ter searching for all relevant studies, 24 were identified for inclusion in the review with a total of 2882 people. The findings are summarised
as follows.
- Physical activity has a small benefit for managing fatigue in people with rheumatoid arthritis.
- Psychosocial therapy has a small benefit for managing fatigue in people with rheumatoid arthritis.
- No other interventions showed a diﬀerence in managing fatigue in people with rheumatoid arthritis. This may have happened by chance.
The information available regarding side eﬀects and complications of the interventions was not very informative although it is unlikely
that any side eﬀects would cause a serious problem.
What is rheumatoid arthritis and what are non-pharmacological interventions?
When you have rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system, which normally fights infection, attacks the lining of your joints. This makes
your joints swollen, stiﬀ and painful. The small joints of your hands and feet are usually aﬀected first. There is no cure for rheumatoid
arthritis at present, so the treatments aim to relieve pain and stiﬀness and improve your ability to move. Fatigue is also a problem for
people with rheumatoid arthritis.
Non-pharmacological interventions include any treatment that is not a registered drug, such as physical activity and psychosocial
interventions (talking therapies). A talking therapy could include meeting with a counsellor, alone or in a group. It might involve writing
about your thoughts and feelings in a journal and talking about it, problem-solving, setting goals and getting feedback about self-
management. It might also include sessions on pain management and relaxation; and coping with depression. There are other non-
pharmacological treatments that have been tested for their eﬀect upon fatigue in people with rheumatoid arthritis. These include diﬀerent
dietary supplements and studies on the eﬀects of giving people access to information about their own disease status. These treatments if
supported by the overall body of evidence would allow the patient to have some personal control of their fatigue.
What happens to people with rheumatoid arthritis who use non-pharmacological interventions?
- At the end of the intervention, people receiving a control had a mean score of 63 on a scale of 0 to 100 with a lower score meaning less
fatigue.
- People who used physical activity rated their fatigue as 54 on a scale of 0 to 100 at the end of the intervention, that is 9 points lower than
the people who received the control.
- People who participated in a psychosocial intervention rated their fatigue as 57 on a scale of 0 to 100 at the end of the intervention, that
is 6 points lower than the people who received the control.

Description of the condition
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an auto-immune, systemic,
inflammatory condition causing pain and synovitis primarily in the
joints of the hands and feet, but o/f_ten involving additional joints
(Conaghan 1999 ). Repeated flares of such disease activity cause
symptoms of pain, fatigue, stiﬀness and long-term loss of function.
People with a range of long-term conditions report clinically
significant fatigue (for example multiple sclerosis, diabetes, stroke)
and it has been identified by RA patients as a key problem,
which they consider harder to manage than pain (Hewlett 2005).
Quantitative studies consistently show that fatigue occurs in up
to 70% of RA patients in the UK (almost 0.4 million people), and
is as common and severe as pain (Department of Health 2006;
Wolfe 1996). Fatigue has been identified by people with RA as
a major concern (Hewlett 2005) and international consensus has
been reached that it should be measured in all clinical trials (Kirwan
2007). Specifically, in 2008, participants including patients at
OMERACT (Outcome Measures in Rheumatology) endorsed fatigue
as an addition to the 'core set' of outcome measures for all future
studies, highlighting the importance of this symptom (Kirwan
2007).
RA fatigue is likely to be explained by multiple and complex
pathways that vary between and within patients over time (Hewlett
2011a). There is currently mixed evidence for the explanatory role
of inflammatory activity and it is likely that additional causal
pathways include behavioural activities (for example boom and
bust behaviours where the individual does too much when they
have some energy, resulting in feeling more fatigued, and then
has to rest for longer), deconditioning from disability, mood (for
example anxiety, depression, helplessness), illness beliefs (for
example unrealistic outlook), stress and pain (Hewlett 2008; Pollard
2006; Treharne 2009). It is possible that the mixed evidence
also arises from the lack of RA-specific fatigue measures and is
associated with the lack of an agreed fatigue definition at the time
these studies were conducted (Hewlett 2011b).
Description of the intervention
Many non-pharmacological approaches to the management of RA
fatigue are used./uni00A0These centre largely around, but are not restricted
to, self-management techniques based upon physical activity and
psychosocial interventions./uni00A0Non-pharmacological interventions
may be initiated or supported by education programmes by the
multi-disciplinary team using processes such as group education
(Hewlett 2008). In terms of physical activity, interventions may
include strategies to increase a person's overall daily activity level
or the implementation of a specific exercise regime such as walking
or cycling for a specific duration at a target intensity. Psychosocial
interventions may include a range of talking therapies that are
based upon a specific behaviour change theory. Previous Cochrane
reviews have been carried out to investigate the eﬀects of non-
pharmacological interventions in RA (Brosseau 2005; Cameron
2011; Casimiro 2002; Casimiro 2005; Egan 2001; Hagen 2009; Han
2004; Hurkmans 2009 ; Pelland 2002; Silva 2010; Tuntland 2009;
Verhagen 2004; Welch 2002 ) but none have specifically investigated
the eﬀects of these interventions on fatigue.How the intervention might work
Non-pharmacological interventions may address several causal
pathways at the same time. For example, education programmes
may work by not only helping people to change behaviours that
perpetuate RA fatigue or inhibit its self-management, through
pacing and lifestyle management, but also by addressing mood and
coping strategies. Exercise interventions may address physiological
deconditioning (either muscular or respiratory) that are associated
with disability or inactivity in RA. Interventions that address
thoughts and feelings around fatigue may encourage helpful
coping strategies, such as emotional expression, reprioritisation
and work and life balance, and help patients reduce perceived
stress and helplessness./uni00A0In addition, the mode of delivery of such
interventions that is eﬀective in bringing about behaviour change
needs to be identified./uni00A0For example, it has been shown in other
Cochrane reviews of group education in musculoskeletal disease
that a cognitive-behavioural therapy approach is more likely to
prompt the adoption of new behaviours than simple information
giving (Riemsma 2003 ).
Why it is important to do this review
No systematic review of non-pharmacological interventions to
help people manage their RA fatigue has been conducted,
therefore the question of whether or not they work has not been
answered./uni00A0Interventions such as group education as reported in
the literature are time-consuming and costly for patients and
professionals, and need to be delivered in a way that results in
behaviour change, therefore the evidence needs evaluating to
enhance practice.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomised controlled trials
Types of participants
Adults (usually over 18 years of age) with a diagnosis of RA
either confirmed by a rheumatologist or using American College of
Rheumatology (ACR) criteria (Arnett 1988).
Types of interventions
All non-pharmacological interventions, which encompassed
all interventions other than those that were classified as
pharmacological. Pharmacological interventions were classified as
medicinal products in accordance with the EU Directive 2001/83/
EEC (EU 2001) which states: "any substance or combination
of substances which may be used in or administered to
human beings either with a view to restoring, correcting or
modifying physiological functions by exerting a pharmacological,

immunological or metabolic action, or to making a medical
diagnosis".
Because of the large number of possible non-pharmacological
interventions, each of which may have many synonyms, there was a
risk of missing some interventions if only specific search terms were
used./uni00A0We therefore initially searched for any randomised controlled
trial reporting RA fatigue and identified the non-pharmacological
interventions from those results.
The comparison arm could have been placebo, an alternative
intervention (pharmacological or non-pharmacological) or usual
care, including no specific intervention for fatigue.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
The primary outcomes for this systematic review were self-
reported fatigue scores using validated measures, and adverse
events. Adverse events were recorded as reported in the studies
on the basis of the Cochrane definition of "harms associated
with healthcare interventions". Distinctions were made between
an adverse event (unfavourable outcome occurring during, but
not necessarily caused by, the intervention), an adverse eﬀect
(reasonable possibility of causal relation) and a side eﬀect (any
unintended eﬀect) (Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions sections 14.1.2 and 14.3.1) (Higgins 2011 ).
Secondary outcomes
Secondary outcomes were pain, anxiety, depression, disability and
tender or swollen joints.
Search methods for identification of studies
The search strategies were developed for MEDLINE in line with
recommendations from the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review
Group and are shown in Appendix 1 . The search strategies
were applied to all databases (adapted appropriately to suit the
database style): EMBASE (Appendix 2 ); CENTRAL (Appendix 3 );
CINAHL (Appendix 4 ); PsycINFO (Appendix 5 ); AMED ( Appendix
6); Web of Science (Appendix 7 ); and Dissertation Abstracts
International (Appendix 8 ).
Electronic searches
The following electronic databases were searched:
•Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (up to
October 2012);
•MEDLINE (1966 to October 2012);
•EMBASE (1983 to October 2012);
•AMED (1985 to October 2012);
•CINAHL (1982 to October 2012);
•PsycINFO (1974 to October 2012);
•Social Science Citation Index (1990 to October 2012);
•Web of Science (1990 to October 2012);
•Dissertation Abstracts International (1871 to October 2012);
•Current Controlled Trials Register (USA) (up to October 2012);
•The National Research Register (NRR) Archive (UK) (up to
October 2012);
•The UKCRN Portfolio Database (UK) (up to October 2012).Searching other resources
In addition, reference lists of studies identified for inclusion in the
review as well as previous review papers were handsearched to
find additional studies, as was the Arthritis Research Campaign
(arc) Topical Review on Fatigue in Musculoskeletal Disease (Hewlett
2008). Relevant authors in the field were contacted to ask
about unpublished research that was not detected by the search
strategies.
Data collection and analysis
Inclusion criteria
Randomised controlled trials of adults with confirmed RA (Arnett
1988) where fatigue was included as a primary or secondary
outcome measure (and not just an adverse eﬀect), reported
separately for RA patients.
Exclusion criteria
Studies that only investigated pharmacological interventions.
Selection of studies
Titles and abstracts were assessed for all records identified through
the search strategies. Two review authors examined each citation
and full papers were retrieved for all those appearing to meet
the inclusion criteria. Full reports were also acquired where there
was any uncertainty surrounding their inclusion or where abstracts
were not available and it was not possible to exclude the trial based
on title alone. Where there were disagreements regarding eligibility
the full text was retrieved. All full text articles were screened for the
inclusion and exclusion criteria by two independent review authors
and any disagreements as to eligibility were resolved by discussion
and the involvement of an arbiter where necessary.
Data extraction and management
For each publication, two review authors (papers allocated
according to expertise) independently retrieved the following
details, tabulated on a standardized form: intervention (including
characteristics and duration); details of the participants' health
status; assignment to study arm (including process used,
concealment and comparability of arms); outcome measures;
timing of measurements; adherence to intervention and control,
sample size and statistical analysis methods (including intention to
treat).
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
For each paper, the two review authors independently assessed
methodological quality using individual components of quality
from tools such as that provided by the Cochrane Collaboration.
Individual components rather than summary scores have been
recommended (Khan 2001 ) in non-pharmacological trials where
blinding of participants in a complex interaction has proved
challenging, meaning that all such trials would score low for
blinding. For such studies it was particularly important to assess
whether obtaining outcome data was blinded.
The risk of bias of the included studies was also assessed by two
independent review authors. As recommended in the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011 ),
the following methodological domains were assessed:

fatigue was made by examining the power calculations reported in
the studies. Assessment of the validity of the fatigue measure used
was made using the methods of Hewlett 2007.
Measures of treatment eﬀect
We expected a range of fatigue outcome measures to have been
used in the identified studies therefore we planned a priori to use
standardised mean diﬀerences. The central estimate (mean) and
standard deviation were recorded. Where the standard deviations
were not explicitly stated, they were calculated from the standard
error, the diﬀerent means and their respective confidence intervals
or P values. Where adverse events were given as dichotomous data,
they were reported as the proportion of patients experiencing the
event in each arm and comparisons made.
Unit of analysis issues
We expected some non-pharmacological interventions to be
delivered at the individual level, where the unit of analysis would
be individual. Where interventions were delivered in groups, the
group was the unit of analysis./uni00A0However, group level interventions
are o/f_ten analysed and reported at an individual rather than group
level, or without adjusting for group eﬀect. Where these group
data were not reported we contacted the authors for further
information.
Dealing with missing data
Where change scores were not available these were sought from the
authors./uni00A0Where they were not available and the mean change could
be calculated, standard deviations were imputed from baseline
data using methods recommended in the Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (section 16.1.3.2) (Higgins
2011).
We intended a priori to carry out an intention-to-treat analysis
in studies where patients allocated to the intervention arm were
included regardless of whether or not they completed the follow-
up. In these studies the assumption should have been made
that patients who dropped out of the study had no changes in
their outcomes, giving a conservative assessment of response to
treatment./uni00A0We requested further details from authors in cases
where published data were incomplete.
Assessment of heterogeneity
Where appropriate, heterogeneity of the data was formally
assessed using the I 2 statistic (Higgins 2003 ). A value greater than
50% may represent substantial heterogeneity. Where substantial
heterogeneity was detected, and there were suﬀicient studiesavailable, subgroup analyses was proposed in an attempt to explain
the heterogeneity.
Assessment of reporting biases
A funnel plot was used to assess the possibility of publication bias.
Data synthesis
Included studies were graded using the GRADE approach
(Schünemann 2008 ), which employs the following rating
system: randomised trials (high), downgraded randomised trials
(moderate), double-downgraded randomised trials (low) and
triple-downgraded randomised trials (very low). The quality ratings
may be decreased by:
1.limitations in the design and implementation of available
studies suggesting high likelihood of bias;
2.indirectness of evidence (indirect population, intervention,
control, outcomes);
3.unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency of results (including
problems with subgroup analyses);
4.imprecision of results (wide confidence intervals); or
5.high probability of publication bias.
We expected a mixture of changes from baseline and absolute study
arm diﬀerences across a variety of measures of RA fatigue./uni00A0We
also expected some variation in methods of analysis, including the
absolute diﬀerence compared between study arms, and baseline-
adjusted diﬀerences between arms./uni00A0We followed the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions guidelines
(Higgins 2011 ) in section 9.4.5.2 in deciding which group of studies
could be included in any meta-analysis./uni00A0We imputed standard
deviations (SD) where necessary according to section 16.1.3.
In studies with multiple intervention arms the number of
participants included in the control arm was divided by the number
of intervention arms to avoid double counting. Where more than
one fatigue outcome existed in a single study, visual analogue scale
(VAS) data, if present, were selected for inclusion in the meta-
analysis. Where VAS data were not available data for the SF-36
vitality scale were utilised. For any remaining studies with multiple
fatigue outcome measures that did not include the VAS or SF36, the
measure selected for use in the review was based upon the findings
of a previous critical review of fatigue scales in RA (Hewlett 2007).
Where there was no heterogeneity a fixed-eﬀect model was used,
and where there was heterogeneity a random-eﬀects model was
proposed./uni00A0When the outcome used or the number, quality or
heterogeneity of existing trials contraindicated meta-analysis, each
study was reported and discussed individually using eﬀect sizes
for fatigue diﬀerence (diﬀerences divided by the SD) using Cohen’s
statistic (0.2 to 0.5 = small eﬀect, 0.5 to 0.8 = moderate, > 0.8 = large
eﬀect) (Cohen 1998 ).
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
Where suﬀicient studies were available and the data were
heterogenous, meta-analyses were carried out for studies using
similar intervention approaches, for example exercise, self-
management education programmes, or cognitive-behavioural
therapy./uni00A0A priori, the categories of physical activity and
psychosocial interventions were expected to emerge from the
available data. A conversion proposed by Chinn (Chinn 2000 ) was

Sensitivity analysis
The following sensitivity analyses were planned a priori in order
to explore diﬀerences in eﬀect size and to assess whether the
conclusions were robust to the decision-making process:
1.the eﬀect of risk of bias in included studies, defined as adequate
allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessors; and2.the eﬀect of imputing missing data or transforming variables.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
Through a comprehensive literature search, including screening
of titles and abstracts (where available), attempts were made to
retrieve 60 full text references for further evaluation. From these,
37 publications were excluded and 23 identified as appropriate for
inclusion in the current review. Screening of reference lists led to
the retrieval of eight further full text studies. One of the eight was
identified as appropriate for inclusion resulting in 24 studies in
total. The 24 publications reported separate trials with one study
(Giraudet-Le-Quintrec 2007) providing additional data in a separate
report.
Included studies
The final selection, based on consensus, resulted in 24 trials being
identified for inclusion in the review. The studies were published
between 1985 and 2012. Three of the included studies (Danoﬀ-
Burg 2006 - I; Neuberger 2007 - I; Riemsma 2003 - I ) incorporated
three separate study arms and were therefore entered twice for the
purpose of statistical analysis.
Participants
Overall, data were available for 2882 participants with RA. The
number of participants completing the studies ranged from 11
(Otter 2010) to 714 (Huﬀstutter 2007).
The mean age of participants fell mainly within the fi/f_th decade
with five studies reporting a mean age in the mid to late 40s
and two reporting the mean age to be in the 60s. One study
specifically recruited housebound patients over the age of 50 years
and subsequently reported a mean age of 77.7 years (Laforest
2008), whereas another study only recruited patients aged 18 to
35 years and reported a mean age of 28.3 years (Evans 2012). Two
studies did not report the gender of participants (Das Gupta 2009;
Otter 2010). Twenty of the remaining 23 studies recruited both
males and females with 19 of these reporting a higher percentage of
females and one not providing these data (Burgos 2009). However,
three of the studies provided gender data for the entire population
recruited with no specific gender data reported for participants
with RA (Danoﬀ-Burg 2006 - I; Lorig 2005; Zangi 2012). Two studies
recruited females only (Evans 2012; Harkcom 1985).
Seventeen studies included participants with RA diagnosed
according to the 1987 ACR criteria, four studies relied upon
verification of RA by a clinician (Hammond 2008 ; Laforest 2008;
Lorig 2005; Otter 2010), one study included participants based
upon the American Rheumatism Association (ARA) 1958 guidelines
(Harkcom 1985). The remaining two/uni00A0studies either did not clarify
the method of diagnosing people with RA (Danoﬀ-Burg 2006 - I) or
did not employ a consistent approach to diagnosis (Lorig 2008).
Nine studies reported that participants' mean duration of disease
was greater than 12 years (Hammond 2008 ; Harkcom 1985; Hewlett
2011; Huﬀstutter 2007; Lumley 2011-I; Otter 2010; Skoldstam 2003;
Wang 2008; Zangi 2012). Three studies reported the mean duration
of disease as less than three years (Bilberg 2005; Danoﬀ-Burg 2006
- I; Hakkinen 2003 ) and a further four studies did not report disease
duration for the participants (Das Gupta 2009; Laforest 2008; Lorig
2005; Lorig 2008).
Interventions
See Table 1Six of the studies investigated physical activity (Bilberg 2005;
Evans 2012; Hakkinen 2003 ; Harkcom 1985; Neuberger 2007 - I;
Wang 2008). The physical activity interventions included pool-
based therapy (Bilberg 2005), yoga (Evans 2012), dynamic strength
training (Hakkinen 2003 ), stationary cycling (Harkcom 1985),
low impact aerobics (Neuberger 2007 - I) and Tai Chi (Wang
2008). Thirteen studies were broadly categorised as investigating
psychosocial interventions (Danoﬀ-Burg 2006 - I; Evers 2002; Furst
1987; Giraudet-Le-Quintrec 2007; Hammond 2008 ; Helliwell 1999;
Hewlett 2011; Laforest 2008; Lorig 2005; Lorig 2008; Lumley 2011-I;
Riemsma 2003 - I ; Zangi 2012). These interventions included benefit
finding (Danoﬀ-Burg 2006 - I), expressive writing (Danoﬀ-Burg 2006
- I; Lumley 2011-I), cognitive behavioural therapy (Evers 2002;
Hewlett 2011; Lumley 2011-I), mindfulness ( Zangi 2012), lifestyle
management (Hammond 2008 ), energy conservation (Furst 1987),
self-management (Laforest 2008; Lorig 2005; Lorig 2008) and group
education (Giraudet-Le-Quintrec 2007; Helliwell 1999; Riemsma
2003 - I). The remaining five studies investigated a range of other
non-pharmacological interventions (Burgos 2009; Das Gupta 2009;
Huﬀstutter 2007; Otter 2010; Skoldstam 2003).
Outcome measures
A wide range of self-report measures were used to assess fatigue,
with six of the 24 studies including two diﬀerent self-report fatigue
measures (Danoﬀ-Burg 2006 - I; Evans 2012; Furst 1987; Hewlett
2011; Neuberger 2007 - I; Wang 2008). Thirteen studies used
variations of a numerical rating scale (NRS) or visual analogue scale
(VAS) to measure fatigue or tiredness (Danoﬀ-Burg 2006 - I; Furst
1987; Hakkinen 2003 ; Hammond 2008 ; Hewlett 2011; Huﬀstutter
2007; Laforest 2008; Lorig 2005; Lorig 2008; Lumley 2011-I; Riemsma
2003 - I; Wang 2008; Zangi 2012)./uni00A0The majority of these studies
used the VAS or NRS to measure average fatigue during a specific
time period, for example the past seven days, although two studies
monitored fatigue levels during a specific activity (Furst 1987;
Hakkinen 2003 )./uni00A0Seven studies used the Short Form 36 (SF-36)
vitality subscale to measure fatigue (Bilberg 2005; Burgos 2009;
Das Gupta 2009; Evans 2012; Helliwell 1999; Skoldstam 2003; Wang
2008)./uni00A0Three studies used the Multidimensional Assessment of
Fatigue (MAF) (Hewlett 2011; Neuberger 2007 - I; Otter 2010), two
studies used the Profile of Mood States (POMS) vigour subscale to
monitor fatigue levels (Danoﬀ-Burg 2006 - I; Neuberger 2007 - I), two
studies used the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy
– Fatigue (FACIT-F) (Evans 2012; Giraudet-Le-Quintrec 2007), and
one used the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS) (Evers 2002). The
final study asked participants to rate their perception of change
in fatigue from baseline using a four point Likert scale (Harkcom
1985).
Fatigue was identified as the single primary outcome in one study
(Otter 2010) and fatigue impact was the single primary outcome
in another study (Hewlett 2011). Burgos 2009 included tiredness
as one of their three primary outcomes./uni00A0Evers 2002 identified
physical, psychological and social functioning as their primary
outcomes, where physical functioning encompassed fatigue. None
of the remaining studies reported fatigue as a primary outcome
although six studies did not identify the primary outcome (Danoﬀ-
Burg 2006 - I; Das Gupta 2009; Evans 2012; Furst 1987; Harkcom
1985; Neuberger 2007 - I).

Excluded studies
The 37 publications that were subsequently excluded did not meet
the review inclusion criteria for the following reasons: 16 were not
RCTs, 13 did not report fatigue as an outcome measure, seven
did not report fatigue data separately for RA patients, and one
paper was unobtainable. Details of the excluded studies can be
found in the Characteristics of excluded studies table. A further
two studies are awaiting classification, with one of the studies
requiring translation (Wiesenauer 1991 ) and for the remaining
study further data are needed before a decision can be made
regarding inclusion (Berbert 2005 ). The additional seven studies
identified through snowballing, which were retrieved in full and
subsequently excluded, did not include fatigue as an outcome.Risk of bias in included studies
Two authors independently reviewed all included studies for ‘risk
of bias’ (Figure 2; Figure 3). Any discrepancies were easily resolved
through group discussion. Eight items were assessed to determine
‘risk of bias’ although it should be noted that three of the eight
items related to blinding (participants, personnel and outcome
assessors). Only published material was used to assess risk of bias
and authors were not contacted to seek clarification. Therefore, a
number of items remained unclear and although it could not be
stated that the quality criteria had been met it equally could not be
stated that they had not been met.

Overall, two studies each met seven (Burgos 2009; Giraudet-Le-
Quintrec 2007), and six ( Hammond 2008 ; Lorig 2005) of the eight
criteria. Five studies met five criteria (Danoﬀ-Burg 2006 - I; Helliwell
1999; Hewlett 2011; Wang 2008; Zangi 2012) and a further three
met four criteria (Bilberg 2005; Evers 2002; Otter 2010). Six studies
only met three criteria (Evans 2012; Hakkinen 2003 ; Laforest 2008;
Lorig 2008; Lumley 2011-I; Neuberger 2007 - I), two met two criteria
(Furst 1987; Skoldstam 2003), two met one criterion (Harkcom 1985;
Riemsma 2003 - I ) and the final two studies did not meet any of the
criteria assessed (Das Gupta 2009; Huﬀstutter 2007).
Based upon intervention category, the studies investigating
physical activity provided moderate quality evidence whereas
the studies investigating psychosocial interventions provided low
quality evidence. The remaining studies, categorised as 'other'
interventions, were assessed as providing low quality evidence
except for the study investigating a Mediterranean diet that was
assessed as providing moderate quality evidence.Allocation
There was poor reporting of the procedures used to conceal trial
arm allocation with 14 of the 24 studies providing insuﬀicient
information to judge this criterion accurately (Bilberg 2005; Das
Gupta 2009; Evans 2012; Evers 2002; Hakkinen 2003 ; Huﬀstutter
2007; Laforest 2008; Lorig 2005; Lorig 2008; Lumley 2011-I;
Neuberger 2007 - I; Otter 2010; Riemsma 2003 - I ; Skoldstam
2003). Further to this, nine of the studies did not report sequence
generation in suﬀicient detail (Danoﬀ-Burg 2006 - I; Das Gupta
2009; Evans 2012; Hakkinen 2003 ; Harkcom 1985; Huﬀstutter 2007;
Lorig 2008; Otter 2010; Riemsma 2003 - I ). The remaining studies
described a variety of acceptable methods for sequence generation
and allocation concealment. In the majority of the latter studies
the methods for developing an 'a priori' list for randomisation
were described and pre-prepared sealed, opaque, sequentially
numbered envelopes were the favoured method of allocation
concealment.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
Based upon intervention category, three of the six physical activity
intervention studies identified appropriate random sequence
allocation (Bilberg 2005; Neuberger 2007 - I; Wang 2008) and
two appropriately concealed allocation (Harkcom 1985; Wang
2008). Ten of the 13 psychosocial intervention studies identified
appropriate random sequence allocation (Evers 2002; Furst
1987; Giraudet-Le-Quintrec 2007; Hammond 2008 ; Helliwell 1999;
Hewlett 2011; Laforest 2008; Lorig 2005; Lumley 2011-I; Zangi 2012)
and seven appropriately concealed allocation (Danoﬀ-Burg 2006 -
I; Furst 1987; Giraudet-Le-Quintrec 2007; Hammond 2008 ; Helliwell
1999; Hewlett 2011; Zangi 2012). For the remaining five studies
only two appropriately identified random sequence allocation
(Burgos 2009; Skoldstam 2003) and only one detailed allocation
concealment adequately (Burgos 2009).
Blinding
Blinding was a limitation for the large majority of the studies. Nine
studies failed to blind participants (Das Gupta 2009; Hammond
2008; Hewlett 2011; Huﬀstutter 2007; Laforest 2008; Lorig 2008;
Neuberger 2007 - I; Otter 2010; Zangi 2012) and a further 10 studies
failed to adequately report blinding of participants (Bilberg 2005;
Evers 2002; Furst 1987; Hakkinen 2003 ; Harkcom 1985; Helliwell
1999; Lumley 2011-I; Riemsma 2003 - I ; Skoldstam 2003; Wang
2008). Fi/f_teen studies did not blind the study personnel (Danoﬀ-
Burg 2006 - I; Das Gupta 2009; Evans 2012; Evers 2002; Giraudet-
Le-Quintrec 2007; Hammond 2008 ; Harkcom 1985; Helliwell
1999; Hewlett 2011; Huﬀstutter 2007; Laforest 2008; Lorig 2008;
Neuberger 2007 - I; Skoldstam 2003; Zangi 2012) and a further six
failed to report the procedure for this (Bilberg 2005; Furst 1987;
Hakkinen 2003 ; Lumley 2011-I; Riemsma 2003 - I ; Wang 2008).
Two studies did not blind the outcome assessors (Huﬀstutter 2007;
Skoldstam 2003) and 10 studies did not report this adequately
(Burgos 2009; Das Gupta 2009; Evans 2012; Evers 2002; Furst 1987;
Hakkinen 2003 ; Harkcom 1985; Lorig 2008; Lumley 2011-I; Riemsma
2003 - I). Several studies acknowledged the diﬀiculties associated
with blinding participants to non-pharmacological interventions
and made attempts to blind the outcome assessor by using
personnel not otherwise involved in the study. However, several of
the studies used subjectively-reported outcomes with unblinded
participants. In this situation the use of a blinded outcome assessor
would not have changed the risk of bias.
All physical activity intervention studies and those categorised as
'other' either did not blind adequately or provided insuﬀicient
information. Only one of the psychosocial intervention studies
provided adequate blinding (Lorig 2005).
Incomplete outcome data
The majority of studies provided complete outcome data with only
four studies assessed as providing incomplete data (Das Gupta
2009; Furst 1987; Harkcom 1985; Huﬀstutter 2007) and a further
four studies judged to be unclear (Danoﬀ-Burg 2006 - I; Laforest
2008; Riemsma 2003 - I ; Skoldstam 2003). The four studies that were
considered to have incomplete outcome data all failed to explain
how missing data were handled. The reasons for participants
leaving the study early were also omitted in some studies. The
studies that met this criterion mainly performed analysis on an
intention-to-treat basis although the methods used varied.
Five of the six physical activity intervention studies were considered
to be at low risk of incomplete outcome data reporting, the
remaining study was considered to be at high risk (Harkcom 1985).For the psychosocial intervention studies, nine were considered
to be at low risk, one at high risk (Furst 1987) and three were
unclear for incomplete outcome data reporting (Danoﬀ-Burg 2006
- I; Laforest 2008; Riemsma 2003 - I ). For the five remaining studies,
two were at low risk, one was unclear (Skoldstam 2003) and two at
high risk (Das Gupta 2009; Huﬀstutter 2007).
Selective reporting
The majority of studies were judged to be free from selective
reporting with only four studies considered to have selectively
reported the findings (Das Gupta 2009; Furst 1987; Harkcom 1985;
Neuberger 2007 - I) and two studies were judged to be unclear
(Huﬀstutter 2007; Lumley 2011-I). One study reported the findings
of an outcome that was not included within the methodology
(Das Gupta 2009) and a further study combined the outcomes
of diﬀerent intervention groups resulting in insuﬀicient detail
(Harkcom 1985). Three studies did not report the results for all the
outcomes listed in the methodology although the authors for one
of these studies subsequently provided these data upon request.
For the physical activity intervention studies, two were considered
to be at high risk of selective reporting (Harkcom 1985; Neuberger
2007 - I) and the remaining four at low risk. For the psychosocial
intervention studies, 11 were considered to be at low risk of
selective reporting, one was unclear (Lumley 2011-I) with the one
remaining study considered to be at high risk (Furst 1987). For
the remaining five studies, three were at low risk, one unclear
(Huﬀstutter 2007) and one at high risk ( Das Gupta 2009) of selective
reporting.
Other potential sources of bias
Thirteen of the 24 studies were considered to be at high risk of
bias for ‘other’ reasons (Bilberg 2005; Das Gupta 2009; Evans 2012;
Furst 1987; Harkcom 1985; Helliwell 1999; Laforest 2008; Lorig
2008; Neuberger 2007 - II; Otter 2010; Skoldstam 2003; Wang 2008;
Zangi 2012). The main reasons identified were study arms being
unbalanced at baseline, a risk of contamination between the arms,
payment of participants in one arm of the study, and control arm
participants advised that they would be entitled to receive the
active intervention at the end of the study period.
For the physical activity intervention studies, five were considered
to be at high risk of other bias (Bilberg 2005; Evans 2012; Harkcom
1985; Neuberger 2007 - I; Wang 2008) and the remaining study
at low risk. For the psychosocial intervention studies, seven were
considered to be at low risk of other bias, one unclear (Riemsma
2003 - I) and five at high risk (Furst 1987; Helliwell 1999; Laforest
2008; Lorig 2008; Zangi 2012). For the remaining five studies, three
were at high risk of selective reporting (Das Gupta 2009; Otter 2010;
Skoldstam 2003) and one was unclear (Huﬀstutter 2007).

psychosocial interventions. The remaining five studies did not fit
within these subgroups and were therefore reported narratively.
Physical activity interventions: eﬀect on fatigue
A meta-analysis was used to combine the mean change scores from
pre- to post-test for the six studies investigating physical activity
interventions (see Analysis 1.1 ). There were a maximum of seven
comparisons possible due to the inclusion of two interventions
in one study (Neuberger 2007 - I). However, mean change data
for fatigue were not available for one of the seven comparisons
(Harkcom 1985). The remaining six comparisons provided data for
219 participants who received a physical activity intervention and152 participants in the control arm. Data were combined using
a random-eﬀects model meta-analysis due to the heterogeneity
within the outcome measures used to assess fatigue. At the
end of the intervention period physical activity was statistically
significantly more eﬀective than the control (SMD -0.36, 95% CI
-0.62 to -0.10; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial
outcome (NNTB) 7, 95% CI 4 to 26), demonstrating a small eﬀect.
The quality of the evidence was graded as moderate using
the GRADE approach (see Summary of findings for the main
comparison). The funnel plot did not demonstrate obvious
publication bias for the physical activity interventions although it
cannot be ruled out (see Figure 4).

Psychosocial interventions: eﬀect on fatigue
A meta-analysis was used to combine the mean change scores
from pre- to post-test for the 13 studies investigating psychosocial
interventions (see Analysis 2.1 ). There were a maximum of 16
comparisons possible due to the inclusion of two intervention
arms in three studies (Danoﬀ-Burg 2006 - I; Lumley 2011-I;
Riemsma 2003 ). However, mean change data for fatigue were not
available for one of the comparisons (Furst 1987). The remaining
15 comparisons provided data for 843 participants who received a
psychosocial intervention and 713 participants in the control arm.
Data were combined using a random-eﬀects model meta-analysisdue to the heterogeneity within the outcome measures used to
assess fatigue./uni00A0At the end of the intervention period psychosocial
interventions were statistically significantly more eﬀective than the
controls (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.07; NNTB 9, 95% CI 6 to 33),
demonstrating a small eﬀect.
The quality of the evidence was graded as low using the GRADE
approach (see Summary of findings for the main comparison).The
funnel plot did not demonstrate obvious publication bias for the
psychosocial interventions although it cannot be ruled out (see
Figure 5).

Other interventions: eﬀect on fatigue
The remaining five studies investigated diverse non-
pharmacological interventions and were therefore not appropriate
for combining within a meta-analysis. In brief, Skoldstam 2003
investigated Mediterranean diet compared to an ordinary Western
diet. The Mediterranean diet arm demonstrated statistically
significant improvement in the SF-36 vitality score at the end of the
intervention (12 weeks) whereas no statistically significant change
was shown in the Western diet arm; between arm comparisons
were not reported (see Analysis 3.1 ). Burgos 2009 investigated the
herbal medicine Andrographis paniculata compared to a placebo.
No statistically significant diﬀerences were reported between
arms for tiredness measured on a VAS (see Analysis 4.1 ). Das
Gupta 2009 investigated omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in
patients receiving indomethacin. Both study arms demonstrated
statistically significant improvements in SF-36 vitality between
baseline and at 12 weeks, with between arm comparisons not
reported (see Analysis 5.1 ). Huﬀstutter 2007 investigated the use
of a data capture system to provide patients with graphical
summarised health information in comparison to a usual care
control arm. Statistical analysis of VAS fatigue data was not
reported. Additional data provided by the authors demonstrated
small improvements in VAS fatigue from baseline to follow-up
in both arms (see Analysis 6.1 ). Finally, Otter 2010 investigated
reflexology compared to a non-specific foot massage with fatigue
as the primary outcome. The authors reported a greater mean
reduction in fatigue in the reflexology arm compared to the control
arm but did not perform inferential statistics on the data due to the
small number of participants (see Analysis 7.1 ).Pain
Two of the 24 studies did not include pain as an outcome (Bilberg
2005; Giraudet-Le-Quintrec 2007). Fourteen of the studies that
measured pain used variations of a VAS or NRS (Burgos 2009;
Danoﬀ-Burg 2006 - I; Das Gupta 2009; Furst 1987; Hakkinen 2003 ;
Hammond 2008 ; Hewlett 2011; Huﬀstutter 2007; Laforest 2008;
Lorig 2005; Lorig 2008; Skoldstam 2003; Wang 2008; Zangi 2012).
Other measures used were a Likert scale (Harkcom 1985); the
short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire (Neuberger 2007 - I), the pain
subscale of the Dutch AIMS2 (Riemsma 2003 - I ; Lumley 2011-I); the
pain scale of the Impact of Rheumatic Diseases on General Health
and Lifestyle (IRGL) (Evers 2002), the Pain Disability Index (Evans
2012), the Bodily Pain subscale of the SF-36 (Helliwell 1999) and the
Manchester Foot Pain Disability Questionnaire (Otter 2010).
For the studies investigating physical activity interventions,
Harkcom 1985 reported improvements in pain over time for the
exercise programme in comparison to home-based exercise or
a control arm. However, statistical analysis was not reported
separately for the pain data. Hakkinen 2003  reported a statistically
significant improvement in average pain intensity at 24 months
in the dynamic strength training arm compared to a control arm
that carried out range of motion and stretching exercises. The
remaining physical activity intervention studies that recorded pain
as an outcome reported no statistically significant eﬀects (Evans
2012; Wang 2008).
Six of the psychosocial intervention studies that measured pain as
an outcome did not report separate RA data (Danoﬀ-Burg 2006 - I;

Hammond 2008 ; Laforest 2008; Lorig 2005; Lorig 2008; Zangi 2012).
Four of the studies reported no statistically significant eﬀects either
over time or between arms (Evers 2002; Helliwell 1999; Hewlett
2011; Riemsma 2003 - I ). One study reported statistically significant
improvement in pain over time but no statistically significant
diﬀerences between the intervention and control arms (Furst 1987).
The final study reported a statistically significant improvement in
pain following a coping skills training intervention compared to
the control education arm but no statistically significant diﬀerence
between the written emotional disclosure arm and control writing
arm (Lumley 2011-I).
For the 'other' categorised interventions, Otter 2010 reported
a decrease in pain for both study arms but no inferential
statistics were carried out. One study reported no statistically
significant eﬀects either over time or between arms (Burgos 2009).
Two of the studies reported statistically significant improvement
in pain over time but no statistically significant diﬀerences
between the intervention and control arms (Das Gupta 2009;
Huﬀstutter 2007). Finally, Skoldstam 2003 reported a statistically
significant reduction in pain following a 12-week Mediterranean
diet intervention in comparison to a usual diet.
Anxiety
Only seven of the 24 studies included anxiety as an outcome
(Danoﬀ-Burg 2006 - I; Evans 2012; Evers 2002; Giraudet-Le-Quintrec
2007; Hewlett 2011; Lumley 2011-I; Zangi 2012) with a range
of diﬀerent assessment methods. Six of the seven studies were
categorised as psychosocial interventions. One of these did not
provide data specific to the RA participants (Zangi 2012) and a
further study did not report the findings for anxiety within the
results (Lumley 2011-I). Danoﬀ-Burg 2006 - I only measured anxiety
at baseline but interestingly reported that higher levels of anxiety
were statistically significantly associated with greater fatigue at
both one and three months (combined data for participants with
RA and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)). Giraudet-Le-Quintrec
2007 and Hewlett 2011 reported no statistically significant changes
in anxiety due to their psychosocial interventions. Evers 2002
also reported no condition by time interaction for anxiety in their
investigation of a cognitive behavioural therapy programme. The
final study that investigated the eﬀect of Ivengar yoga reported no
statistically significant eﬀect for anxiety (Evans 2012).
Depression
Ten studies included depression as an outcome (Danoﬀ-Burg 2006 -
I; Evans 2012; Evers 2002; Giraudet-Le-Quintrec 2007; Hewlett 2011;
Laforest 2008; Lumley 2011-I; Neuberger 2007 - I; Wang 2008; Zangi
2012) with the Centre for Epidemiological Studies depression scale
(CES-D) being used in four of the 10 studies. Two of the studies
did not provide full outcome data or an analysis for the depression
data (Laforest 2008; Lumley 2011-I) and a further two studies
only provided combined data for participants with inflammatory
arthritis (Danoﬀ-Burg 2006 - I; Zangi 2012).
For physical activity interventions, Neuberger 2007 - I reported
an overall positive eﬀect for depression but results for univariate
analysis were not reported. Wang 2008 reported a decrease in
depression immediately following a 12-week Tai Chi programme
with a corresponding increase in depression in the control arm and
an overall statistically significant between arm eﬀect. Evans 2012
reported that there was no statistically significant eﬀect due to an
Ivengar yoga intervention compared to a control arm.For psychosocial interventions, one study reported no statistically
significant eﬀects in relation to depression (Giraudet-Le-Quintrec
2007). Evers 2002 and Hewlett 2011 reported that depression was
statistically significantly reduced following a cognitive behavioural
therapy intervention in comparison to the control arms.
Disability
Eighteen of the 24 studies included disability as an outcome
measure. Sixteen of the 18 studies used the Health Assessment
Questionnaire (HAQ) or a modified version of the HAQ to assess
disability. The remaining studies used the Mobility and Self-care
scales of the Impact of Rheumatic Diseases on General Health and
Lifestyle to assess disability (Evers 2002) or the Arthritis Impact
Measurement Scales 2 (AIMS2) physical disability subscale Lumley
2011-I).
Four of the six studies categorised as physical activity studies
included disability as an outcome. The studies investigating
hydrotherapy (Bilberg 2005) and Tai Chi (Wang 2008) demonstrated
statistically significant improvements in the intervention arm
compared to the control arm between baseline and follow-up. The
studies investigating strength training (Hakkinen 2003 ) and Ivengar
yoga (Evans 2012) did not demonstrate a statistically significant
diﬀerence between study arms.
Ten of the 13 studies investigating psychosocial interventions
included disability as an outcome measure although four of these
did not provide separate RA data (Danoﬀ-Burg 2006 - I; Hammond
2008; Lorig 2005; Lorig 2008). Four of the six remaining studies
reported no statistically significant time by arm interaction (Evers
2002; Giraudet-Le-Quintrec 2007; Helliwell 1999; Lumley 2011-I).
One study (Furst 1987) did not carry out statistical analysis of
the disability data but reported that there were no diﬀerences
between the arms over time. The final study reported statistically
significantly better disability in the trial arm that had received
cognitive behavioural therapy compared to the control arm at the
primary endpoint (Hewlett 2011).
In the remaining studies, Burgos 2009 reported a statistically
significant improvement in disability over time with no
statistically significant diﬀerences between the arm receiving
andrographolides and the placebo arm. Skoldstam 2003 reported
a statistically significant diﬀerence between arms from baseline to
the 12-week follow-up. Findings were in favour of the intervention
arm receiving the Mediterranean diet. Finally, Das Gupta 2009 and
Huﬀstutter 2007 did not present the findings for disability despite
including the HAQ as an outcome measure within the methods.
Tender and swollen joints
Several studies included the Disease Activity Score (DAS28) as
an outcome. This outcome incorporates an assessment of the
number of tender and swollen joints. However, the separate scores
were o/f_ten not reported. Studies were only reported here that
provided separate evaluation of tender or swollen joints, or both,
or results for the Ritchie Articular Index (a graded assessment of 26
joint regions to assess tenderness plus a 44 joint count to assess
swelling). Ten of the 19 studies met these criteria.
Four of the studies investigating physical activity interventions
reported findings for tender and swollen joints. Harkcom
1985 reported statistically significant reductions in joint counts
(combined tenderness and swelling scores) in all three cycle

ergometry intervention arms between baseline and post-
treatment, with a statistically non-significant reduction in the
control arm. However, statistical analysis was not reported for
between arm comparisons. Hakkinen 2003  reported improvements
in the Ritchie Articular Index (RAI) in both the strength training
arm and the control arm with no statistically significant diﬀerences
between arms. Neuberger 2007 - I reported no statistically
significant diﬀerences in total joint count between the low impact
aerobic exercise arms and the control arm. Similarly, Wang
2008 reported no statistically significant diﬀerences between the
hydrotherapy arm and control arm in relation to joint pain, joint
swelling or RAI values.
Only two of the studies investigating psychosocial interventions
measured and reported tender and swollen joint counts. Furst
1987 reported a statistically non-significant increase in RAI (worse)
in both the energy conservation arm and the control. Between
arm statistical analysis was not however reported. Helliwell 1999
reported no statistically significant diﬀerence in RAI between
patients receiving group education and a control.
In the remaining studies, Burgos 2009 reported no statistically
significant diﬀerence in tender joint counts, swollen joint counts,
grade of swollen joints or grade of tender joints between the
herbal medicine and control arm from baseline to follow-up.
Das Gupta 2009 reported that tender and swollen joint counts
decreased statistically significantly in the arm receiving omega-3
fatty acids as well as the placebo control arm. Between arm
statistical analysis was not reported. Huﬀstutter 2007 reported a
statistically significant improvement in mean painful joint count in
the arm receiving health tracker data compared to a statistically
non-significant improvement in the control arm. Again, between
trial arm statistical analysis was not reported. Finally, Skoldstam
2003 demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in swollen
joint count over time in the trial arm receiving a Mediterranean
diet compared to the control arm. There was no corresponding
diﬀerence in tender joint counts.
Adverse events
No adverse events were reported in 21 of the 24 studies. However,
in some cases it was not clear if this was due to the absence of
any adverse events or poor reporting. The remaining three studies
reported adverse events (Burgos 2009; Huﬀstutter 2007; Skoldstam
2003) but none were serious and there was no clear diﬀerence
in the incidence or severity of the adverse events between the
intervention and control arms. No adverse eﬀects or side eﬀects
were reported in any of the studies.

Summary of main results
The aim of this review was to provide an overview of the
benefits and harms of non-pharmacological interventions for
fatigue in people with RA. The review revealed 24 studies in
which a non-pharmacological intervention had been investigated
in an RCT design and fatigue had been included as an
outcome measure. The interventions were heterogenous with six
studies investigating a form of physical activity, 13 investigating
a psychosocial intervention, and the five remaining studies
investigating a herbal medicine, Mediterranean diet, omega-3 fatty
acid supplementation, reflexology and the provision of healthtracker information. The quality of the evidence varied from low to
moderate.
Overall completeness and applicability of evidence
One study identified fatigue as the single primary outcome and a
further study identified fatigue impact as a the primary outcome.
Tiredness was also identified as the primary outcome in one
study and a further study included fatigue as one of several
primary outcomes. As a consequence the primary purpose of
the interventions for the majority of studies was not fatigue
reduction and there was little or no apparent consideration of
fatigue mechanisms in the design of the interventions. Future
research needs to focus specifically upon fatigue to determine
the most eﬀective methods for management. Interventions should
also be designed with consideration given to potential causal
pathways and mechanisms of fatigue. The lack of specific focus
on fatigue within the included studies may have resulted in
an underestimation of the eﬀectiveness of non-pharmacological
interventions. It should be noted that only one of the studies
identified the presence of fatigue as a specific inclusion criteria. It
is highly likely that for some participants fatigue was not a clinically
significant problem thus reducing the potential for improvement.
Future research therefore needs to be undertaken with fatigued
participants. Further to this, only one of the included studies was
specifically powered to detect a change in fatigue, although it
is likely that some studies did have suﬀicient numbers for this
purpose. It is possible that fatigue has been included as a secondary
outcome in additional studies and not reported where no eﬀect
was detected. This potential for selective reporting may have led
to an exaggeration in the benefits of the included interventions
upon fatigue. The absence of reporting of adverse events or side
eﬀects does not allow the important benefits to be balanced against
potential harms.
Quality of the evidence
Fatigue outcome measures need to be standardised in future RA
research. Although 13 of the included studies used a NRS or
VAS there was no standardisation of the root question or anchor
statements. A range of other multi-dimensional fatigue measures
were used that have not been validated in full for use in RA, for
example, the FACIT-F, MAF and CIS (Hewlett 2011b). The use of
the SF-36 may also be questionable as vitality may not be at
the opposite end of the spectrum to fatigue. Consistent use of
outcomes would simplify pooling of data and allow comparison
between interventions.
Due to inadequate reporting in the majority of included studies it
was o/f_ten not possible to determine whether the quality criteria
had been met. This resulted in a large number of items being
scored as unclear rather than met or not met. Blinding was
highlighted as a limitation in the majority of the included studies.
There are inherent diﬀiculties in blinding non-pharmacological
interventions, although it is not impossible and future research
needs to make eﬀorts to address this to limit risk of bias.
Potential biases in the review process
The inclusion criteria for this review were intentionally broad
to capture all non-pharmacological interventions that may have
potential to reduce fatigue in patients with RA. Unsurprisingly
this resulted in heterogeneity between the interventions under
investigation. For the purpose of data pooling an artificial cut

oﬀ was created between psychosocial and physical activity
interventions. In general it was clear where the main component
of the intervention was physical activity or psychosocial, however,
there was also some overlap in a few studies. In the future,
assuming that the number and quality of studies increases, it
may be possible to determine a priori meta-analysis with more
homogenous interventions. It may also be possible to perform
meta-analysis upon intervention subgroups; for example, physical
activity interventions may be classified as primarily aerobic training
or resistance training. This would help to create consensus in
relation to optimal management of fatigue and better informed
clinical guidelines.

Implications for practice
There is some evidence that physical activity interventions and
psychosocial interventions may help to reduce fatigue in RA.However, the optimal parameters and components of these
interventions are not yet established.
Implications for research
High quality randomised controlled trials with cost eﬀectiveness
analysis are necessary to determine the optimal non-
pharmacological management of fatigue in RA. The initial priority
should be to identify the optimal physical activity and psychosocial
interventions with fatigue as the primary outcome. Further to this,
it is essential that trials are reported in line with the CONSORT
statement. In particular, adverse events and side eﬀects need to be
incorporated in future publications even when none occur.

Interventions During the first 6 months of study participation (pre-randomisation), ALL enrolled patients and their
physicians entered data into the Electronic Data Capture System at each visit; however, Health Tracker
(HT) reports summarizing the patients’ and physicians’ assessments of the first 6 months of visits were
not available to any patients or physicians.
For intervention arm only: Health Tracker (HT) reports integrated and summarized each patients da-
ta generated at specific study visits occurring 6 to 12 months after study entry, including graphical dis-
plays of the number of patient-defined painful joints, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) scores,
Short Form (SF)-12 scores, physician and patient global assessment scores, and anti-rheumatic med-
ications over time.
Outcomes Primary outcomes: Patients overall satisfaction with 8 aspects of their care: VAS 0 cm (completely un-
satisfied) to 10 cm (completely satisfied). Physicians: 6-item patient-physician interaction question-
naire using a VAS (lower scores = easier interactions)
Relevant secondary: pain (VAS), disability (HAQ), patients self-evaluated painful joints on a joint man-
nequin diagram in EDCS, and a trained assessor examined patients and separately entered the painful
and swollen joint count in the EDCS.
Other: Global disease assessments by the patient and the physician. Health-related quality of life

Methods RCT: 2 arms
Participants RA, diagnosed for at least 2 years, stable disease assessed by rheumatologist
Interventions Mediterranean Cretan diet (MD) including reduced fat, more green/black tea. Served by hospital for 3
weeks with 6 lessons about Mediterranean cooking from dietician. After rehabilitation same dietician
was available weekly for telephone consultation and every third week for face to face consultation.
All MD patients got written instructions and recipes to facilitate the preparation of meals at home. The
meals that both the MD and the control patients had to prepare at home were (a) every day breakfast
and evening snacks; (b) meals for two weekends during rehabilitation; (c) every meal for the remaining
nine weeks that followed rehabilitation. To enhance compliance, some food items were supplied free
to the MD patients (olive oil, canola oil, liquid margarine, spreadable margarine, frozen vegetables, and
tea).
Outcomes Primary: disease activity (DAS 28), disability (Swedish HAQ), Health-related quality of life (SF-36
Swedish version), daily non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

The authors do not have any conflicts of interest.
At the time of protocol development Sarah Hewlett was in receipt of a small unrestricted educational grant from GlaxoSmithKline to
partially fund a PhD studentship on fatigue measurement in RA. She was also undertaking an RCT of cognitive behavioural therapy for the
self-management of RA fatigue, funded by the Arthritis Research Campaign./uni00A0During the full review process Sarah Hewlett also received a
small consultancy fee from UCB Pharmaceuticals to advise on the translatation of the Bristol RA Fatigue Scales. These associations reflect
our large programme of research in fatigue into RA but do not constitute a conflict of interests.
