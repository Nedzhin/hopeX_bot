Predictors of fatigue in rheumatoid arthritis
Katie L. Druce1and Neil Basu2
Abstract
People with RA commonly experience fatigue. Fatigue is a key contributor to increased clinical care costs,
primary care consultations and employment loss. Despite this, our understanding of the prognostic of
factors of poor fatigue outcomes is lacking and fatigue is poorly managed. Examining longitudinal pre-dictors of fatigue can identify both individuals ‘at risk’ of poor prognosis, and candidate mechanisms thatare worthy of greater inspection. This review discusses the factors most commonly investigated as beingimplicated in the prognosis of RA fatigue. The available data appears to implicate generic factors such aspain, mental health, disability and sleep as consistent predictors of fatigue outcome, while the role ofdisease activity and inflammation seems less clear. However, the existing data are not without methodo-logical limitations and there have been no specific studies primarily designed to investigate the inflam-
matory biomarkers of fatigue. Future studies are required to more comprehensively and robustly
determine the mechanisms of fatigue.

Introduction
People with RA commonly experience fatigue [1, 2].
Fatigue is the subjective experience of intense tiredness
or exhaustion, is often unrelated to energy exertion and
not relieved by rest [3]. Prevalence studies consistentlyreport fatigue rates between four and eight times higher(depending on the classification criteria used) [1, 4, 5] than
the general population prevalence of 10% [6]. Fatigue may
be experienced as a chronic state of weariness or as arecurrent symptom with rapid fluctuations occurring within
the same day or between days [1, 2, 7 /C1509]. Regardless, the
longer term prognosis is burdensome, with up to 74% ofRA patients experiencing persistently high or worsening
levels of fatigue [10].
Fatigue has received much attention in recent years,
largely in response to work from the OMERACT meetings
[11/C15013], which highlighted the symptom as a core patientoutcome. Yet, fatigue remains a key contributor to
increased clinical care costs [14], one of the most
common reasons for consultation to primary care [15]and a key determinant of sickness absence and loss of
employment [2, 7, 15]. Thus, despite this perceived im-
portance and increased research activity, our understand-ing of the prognostic factors of poor fatigue outcomes is
lacking and, subsequently, fatigue is poorly managed.
The longitudinal prediction of fatigue aids the identifica-
tion of individuals ‘at risk’ of poor prognosis enabling early
targeted intervention. In parallel, such factors are often
worthy of greater inspection as candidate mechanisms.To date, evidence regarding the prediction of fatigue islimited. There is a high degree of variation in the type of
putative predictors investigated in studies and many fac-
tors are investigated in single studies only, making inter-pretation difficult. For these reasons, this review has
focused on discussing the factors most commonly inves-
tigated as being implicated in the prognosis of RA fatigue:disease activity and inflammation, pain, sleep, mental
health and disability.
Disease activity and inflammation
Historically, fatigue has been perceived to be caused by
disease-specific processes, such as inflammation and1Centre for Epidemiology Versus Arthritis, Faculty of Biology Medicine

joint damage [16, 17]. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, which
are pivotal to RA progression, have been linked to fatiguevia sickness behaviour [18] and it is possible that theseinflammatory processes initially trigger fatigue in RA [18,19]. Certainly, while the apparent response of fatigue toinflammation-focused interventions [5, 20 /C15022] would indi-
cate that an association between inflammatory diseaseactivity and fatigue exists, it is now widely recognizedthat fatigue persists despite receiving the best availablecare for their disease [23, 24], although anti-inflammatorypharmacological interventions do confer reductions in fa-tigue in subgroups of patients [20, 25].
Where an association has been observed between in-
flammation and fatigue prognosis, it has tended to showboth that higher [26] and lower [24, 27] inflammation isassociated with greater fatigue, depending on the studyin question. Further, within a path analysis model [28], wefound that when DAS-28 was substituted for ESR or CRPthe direct relationship between disease activity and fa-tigue disappeared, indicating that it may be that the pa-
tient reported/influenced (e.g. patient global and tender
joints), which drive the associations between DAS-28and fatigue. Overall, the balance of evidence wouldseem to indicate that while fatigue prognosis may beassociated with composite measures of disease activity[5, 10, 22, 28, 29], it is not consistently predicted by trad-itional measures of inflammation, such as CRP or ESR [22,28/C15030].
Yet, understanding the precise nature of the association
between fatigue and inflammatory disease activity is diffi-cult and much of the available data are conflicting andlimited. A principal barrier to elucidating the predictiverole of inflammatory disease processes in fatigue progno-sis is that disease activity can be measured globally, usingscales such as the DAS for 28 joints (DAS-28), or by indi-vidual components such as measures of inflammation ortender and swollen joints. A second key barrier is thatthere has been little exploration of fatigue-specific inflam-matory biomarkers. Investigations regarding the role ofinflammation in fatigue have been limited to studying theprognostic role of the non-specific inflammatory markerstypically used in clinic (CRP and ESR). Indeed, evidencefrom RA and other disease groups that fatigue is pre-dicted by a range of pro-inflammatory cytokines not typ-ically collected in clinics including TNF- a, IL-1, IL-6 and
IFN-g[31/C15036]. Thus, it may be that there are as yet un-
identified specific inflammatory markers of RA-fatiguethat, if targeted, could reduce symptom burden.
Pain
Pain is commonly investigated as a possible predictor offatigue [5, 10, 21, 23, 24, 27, 28, 37 /C15041] and has been
identified by patients as a principal cause of their fatigue[7, 42, 43]. Evidence across a number of studies indicatesthat increased pain is associated both with greater mag-nitude of fatigue over time [10, 37, 40, 41] and with fatiguepersistence [22]. Furthermore, change in pain was notonly associated with the magnitude of fatigue change [5,28], but was also found to mediate the effect of change indisease activity on fatigue outcomes [28]. As a result,
some authors have argued that it is pain, not disease ac-
tivity, that drives fatigue [5, 28], and it has been suggested
then that improved pain management should be a keyfocus of fatigue interventions.
However, van Dartel et al. showed that the relationship
between pain and fatigue is significant, but synchronous[39], and others have shown that greater fatigue is asso-
ciated with concurrently higher pain despite disease re-
mission [23, 24]. Thus, while it is clear that the twosymptoms are associated, the link between the symptoms
may be due to the existence of a shared aetiology, such
as central sensitization [44, 45] rather than ‘cause andeffect’ per se . Irrespective of this, it seems likely that inter-
ventions seeking to reduce pain may have beneficial ef-
fects on fatigue.
Sleep
Proposing the existence of a relationship between sleepand fatigue would appear intuitive, because it is clear thatdisturbed sleep leads to tiredness and daytime sleepi-
ness. However, while overlapping in description, sleepi-
ness and tiredness are distinct from fatigue [7] and thenature of their association is unclear. Furthermore, sleep
is a complex behaviour that is composed of both subject-
ive and objective components and, despite the rise inavailability of sleep and activity trackers [46], few studies
have measured both components [47]. Nevertheless, stu-
dies have indicated that there is an association betweenthe magnitude of sleep problems reported and corres-
ponding levels of fatigue [40, 48, 49] and that baseline
levels of sleep problems were higher among individualswho did not go on to experience improvements in fatigue
[10]. On the other hand, others have shown that the rela-
tionship between sleep problems, or use of sleep medi-cations, and fatigue is not significant [22, 27, 38].
The most convincing evidence regarding the relation-
ship between sleep and fatigue arises from theexperimental literature, which show that experimentally
induced sleep deprivation has been associated with
increased fatigue [50, 51]. It is important to considerthough that there appears to be a complex interplay be-
tween sleep, pain and fatigue [50 /C15052]. None of the avail-
able studies were found to determine whether disturbedsleep has a direct effect on fatigue, or whether its effect
might be indirect and mediated through the elevated pain
levels that are observed following episodes of poor sleep[52, 53]. It is clear that further work is needed to determine
the precise temporal nature and pathways between both
objective and subjectively recorded sleep and resultantchanges in fatigue.
Mental health
The relationship between mental health and fatigue ap-pears to be particularly important, as poor mental health
both predisposes an individual to, and perpetuates, fa-
tigue [54 /C15056]. Mental health may typically be defined in
many ways, such as previous diagnosis of depression
[10, 21, 28, 54 /C15056], current levels of dysphoria [54 /C15056] or
v30 https://academic.oup.com/rheumatologyKatie L. Druce and Neil BasuDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article/58/Supplement_5/v29/5552807 by guest on 07 November 2023
position on a mental health continuum (e.g. Short Form 36
Mental Health Scale) [10, 21, 22, 28, 57], or use of anti-
depressants [10, 21]. Irrespective of the definition, the evi-
dence indicates that higher depression scores, or ratingsof dysphoria, in combination with previous history of de-
pression is associated with an exacerbation of, or failure
to improve, fatigue [10, 21, 29, 54 /C15057]. Evidence also in-
dicates that less improvement in mental health complaints
is associated with less concurrent improvement in fatigue
[28, 29, 56], and that mental health remains poor amongthose who experience persistent fatigue despite disease
management [22, 23]. However, it is important to acknow-
ledge that fatigue is included as a symptom in diagnosticcriteria for depression [58], so delineating the predictive
nature of the relationship can be complicated.
Far fewer studies have investigated the link between
fatigue and other aspects of mental health such as anxiety
and stress, but evidence would seem to indicate that anx-
iety, stress and negative interpersonal events are asso-ciated with poor fatigue prognosis [36 /C15038, 59].
Disability
Levels of disability, largely measured by the Stanford
HAQ, have consistently linked high levels of disability toreduced likelihood of improvement, greater likelihood of
persistence [10, 21 /C15023, 29, 60], and a greater magnitude
of fatigue over time [38, 40]. It is clear that the swelling andprogressive joint damage that characterize RA may in-
crease the magnitude of effort required to complete
daily tasks and lead to increased fatigue. In the era ofbiologics and bio-similars, interpreting the role of disability
in fatigue is complicated, as many of the patients more
recently diagnosed will avoid the year-on-year progres-sion of joint damage and disability that once typified the
course of RA [61, 62], but continue to report fatigue. That
being said, fatigue has been referred to as a disablingsymptom [42, 43], and one that makes completion of
daily tasks difficult, if not impossible. Given the non-spe-
cific nature of disability questionnaires such as the HAQ(e.g. ‘Are you able to wash and dry your entire body?’) it is
not clear the extent to which fatigue at the time of report-
ing has influenced the levels of disability recorded forparticipants.
Limitations of the available data
It is first worth highlighting that a range of measures existto study fatigue within RA populations [9, 63]. Thesemeasures, which have been validated to a greater or
lesser extent within the population, may measure various
things such as the magnitude or qualities of fatigue,including severity, impact or coping (e.g. Bristol
Rheumatoid Arthritis Fatigue Scale Multidimensional
Questionnaire (BRAF MDQ), or Numerical Rating Scales(BRAF NRS)). Measures may also distinguish between
mental and physical fatigue (e.g. Chalder Fatigue Scale)
or include assessment of both the quality and type of fa-tigue, such as measuring physical fatigue, emotional fa-
tigue and the social consequences of fatigue (e.g.
Functional Assessment Chronic Illness Therapy(Fatigue)). Finally, measures may position people on a
continuum from energy to fatigue (Short-Form 36 Vitality
(SF36 VT)). It is clear that the measures used may have
substantial impacts on the associations observed if a pre-
dictor is differentially associated with distinct dimensions
of fatigue [9]. It is notable that few studies have usedscales that capture the multidimensionality of fatigue, in-
stead relying on single-item visual analogue scales, or nu-
merical rating scales [5, 10, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 37, 41, 49,
54, 56, 57]. Equally, there is no consistency in the defin-
itions and measures used to capture exposures of interestand no single study has investigated all predictors of inter-
est, making it likely that residual confounding exists and
precluding the development of an evidence-based causal
model/diagram of fatigue.
In addition, many of the longitudinal studies available
are methodologically compromised, being limited to infre-
quent (i.e. yearly), or short-term (i.e. one week) fatigue
assessments, in small samples. As a result, many studies
have predicted fatigue over disparate time points or have
tended to aggregate longitudinal data to investigate the‘normal’ pattern of fatigue, despite high within- and be-
tween-person variation. Such analyses are particularly
problematic, given growing evidence regarding the likelyexistence of fatigue sub-types [10, 64 /C15066]. Therefore,
while the available evidence can provide some interesting
insights into the possible predictors of fatigue, it is clear
that additional, more methodologically robust, studies are
needed.
Are the causes of RA-fatigue disease specific?
On balance, and based on the available evidence, it ap-pears likely that the predictors of fatigue are not unique toRA populations. Rather, some of the most consistent can-
didates have been identified as predictors in other rheum-
atic diseases, such as osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia, as
well as in a broader range of long-term medical conditions
such as multiple sclerosis and cancer [2, 5, 18, 19, 28, 48,50, 51, 54, 55, 67 /C15071]. Together, this points towards an as
yet untested hypothesis that fatigue, its prognostic fac-
tors, and therefore its optimal treatment strategy, may
be common across many long-term illnesses, irrespective
of whether they have an inflammatory aetiology. Futurestudies may benefit from investigating this hypothesis
with a view to developing generic fatigue interventions
across a range of chronic conditions.
Conclusion
People with RA commonly experience fatigue. Despite theperceived importance of, and increased research activity
regarding, fatigue, the symptom’s prognosis remains
poorly understood and poorly managed. The availabledata appears to implicate generic factors such as pain,
mental health, disability and sleep as consistent pre-
dictors of fatigue outcome, while the role of disease-spe-
cific factors such as inflammatory processes seems less
clear. However, there have been no specific studies con-ducted to investigate the inflammatory biomarkers of fa-
tigue and available studies are limited to those with

infrequent and short follow-up, or examinations of aver-
age prognosis over time. Thus, while insightful, the exist-ing evidence is not definitive and future studies arerequired to more comprehensively and robustly determinethe mechanisms of symptom prognosis over time.
